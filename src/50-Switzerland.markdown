## Introduction to software protection under Swiss Law

### Applicable Law

Under Swiss law, the protection of software is principally regulated by
the Federal Copyright Act of October 9, 1992[^switzerland_1], last revised on July
1st, 2008 (“SCA”).

### Object of Protection

#### Definition of software

Pursuant to Section 2, paragraph 3 SCA, computer programs are considered
to be works under Swiss law, and as such, can be protected by
copyright[^switzerland_2]. Computer programs are purposely protected in a separate
category of works from literary works[^switzerland_3]. The notion of computer
programs as used in the Copyright Act includes any completed process
written in a programming language with the purpose of performing a
designated task[^switzerland_4]. The protection of computer programs comprises the
protection of the source code and of the object code of the computer
program, but it does not cover the ideas or principles on which the
software is based (algorithm, formula, etc.)[^switzerland_5]. It is also generally
understood that the copyright protection of computer programs does not
extend to the development nor the user’s documentation, which can
however be copyrighted separately to the extent that it meets the
requirement of protection for literary works as stated in Section 2
paragraph 1 SCA[^switzerland_6].

For the purpose of this Swiss chapter, the terms of “software” or
“computer software” will be deemed equivalent to “computer program”, as
defined above. We are aware of the distinction drawn between a software
and a computer program in relation with Open Source and within numerous
Open Source licenses[^switzerland_7]. A debate exists among Swiss scholars regarding
this differentiation, the main issue being related to the inclusion of
the documentation in the notion of software and therefore in the
definition of protected work, with the consequence that the
documentation should be covered by the exclusive rental right (see I.4
(b) below). The terms of “software” and “computer program” are however
being used interchangeably in the French version of the Copyright Act as
well as in the Message of the Federal Council which preceded the
adoption of the revised Act, and we will therefore consider both terms
to fall under the same definition in relation to Swiss copyright law.

#### Protected software

In order to be protected under Swiss copyright law, computer software
needs to meet the requirement of individual character, which is the
basic requirement for each protected work[^switzerland_8]. Such individual character
should only be found in the structure of the program, and not in the
ideas or the software’s algorithms or logic, which are not protected by
copyright. This requirement for computer programs must however be
understood as a requirement of novelty or an absence of triviality[^switzerland_9].
Thus, computer software will be deemed to possess sufficient individual
character if experts find it original and different from other existing
software by the comparison of their source and object codes[^switzerland_10] and to
the extent that the author had sufficient leeway at his/her disposal in
the writing of the codes[^switzerland_11].

#### Unprotected and public domain software

As a consequence of the requirements set forth in Section 2 of the
Copyright Act, Swiss law shall not protect software that does not
possess an individual character. Thus, a computer program that
professionals will find trivial in relation to preexisting ones, when
comparing their codes, and for which the author has not showed any
creativity in the writing of the code, shall not be considered as a
protected work under copyright law, and can therefore be freely used, to
the extent that it is not limited by existing covenants governing it or
by the general rules of unfair competition[^switzerland_12]. Furthermore, the
protection of software developed by a computer is discussed under Swiss
law, as some specialized authors consider that the human intervention is
too remote to trigger the legal protection of the work[^switzerland_13].

Under Swiss law, two categories of software will be considered as public
domain: (i) software for which the protection has expired through lapse
of time (50 years after the death of the author; see I.6 below for more
details), and (ii) software for which the author has voluntarily given
up his/her rights and which he/she has offered for the use of the
public. This type of public domain software is characterized by the
absence of exclusive enforceable rights on the software and the free
availability of the computer program, but not necessarily of the source
code. Due to the absence of a registration requirement for copyrighted
works in Swiss copyright law however, the author of the software who
wishes to make it a public domain software must express it clearly, for
instance through a notice attached to each copy of the software[^switzerland_14].
The public domain software must be distinguished from the Free and Open
Source Software (FOSS)[^switzerland_15]: in the case of FOSS, the author or
co-authors license their rights to the users by giving access to the
source code but remain the valid holders of the copyright on the
software, whereas public domain software can be validly used, modified,
or published without the need for the issuance of a license.

### Owner of rights

#### Author as a natural person

Pursuant to Section 6 SCA, an author is the natural person who created
the protected work[^switzerland_16]. Thus, in the case of computer software, the
programmer who created the software will be considered to be its author
in the sense of copyright law, and therefore will own the copyright to
the protected work[^switzerland_17]. As a result and contrary to what is the case in
the USA for example[^switzerland_18], a corporate entity or a legal person cannot be
the “original” author of a computer program, even when it has for
instance financed the development of the program. In such a case
however, the corporate entity may benefit from the mechanism of legal
assignment of certain exclusive rights in favor of the employer
regarding software created by an employee (see section I.3 below).

#### Joint work : coauthors

In the development of a computer program, there is often more than one
person involved, and therefore more than one author in the sense of
copyright law. Most of the time, the developed software will be
considered as a joint work, created by several coauthors. Pursuant to
Section 7 SCA, a coauthor is a natural person who contributed to the
creation of a work by bringing in his/her creative input[^switzerland_19]. The two
main criteria are thus (i) the objective creative collaboration but also
(ii) the intent of the authors to create a work together. The coauthor
of a protected work must be distinguished from an auxiliary, who simply
performs a task he/she has been entrusted with, with no provision for
any creative input, and who therefore does not own any rights to the
protected work[^switzerland_20]. In addition, the determining factor that will allow
a work to be deemed a joint work and not a derivative work is the
accepted and voluntary joint creative collaboration on a common and
unique creation within an agreed period of time.

In the case of a joint work, the coauthors are the joint holders of the
copyright, with the consequence that they can only use the joint work in
common or with each coauthor’s agreement and that one coauthor cannot
dispose of his/her share without the consent of the others[^switzerland_21]. The
coauthors have however a duty to make the use of the work possible and
they cannot withhold their authorization of use without cause[^switzerland_22]. Each
coauthor has the standing to represent the joint tenancy of coauthors in
case of infringement, but this does not affect the joint ownership of
the copyright by all coauthors[^switzerland_23].

The legal regime of the Copyright Act applicable to coauthors has been
construed by the Swiss Supreme Court as establishing a “sui generis
joint ownership”, with the consequence that it does not correspond to
any regime of co-ownership already existing under Swiss law[^switzerland_24]. Aside
from the mandatory rules on co-authorship and in particular on the joint
ownership of the joint work set out in Section 7 SCA, the coauthors may
choose to regulate their relationship via an express agreement,
regulating for instance the decision making process or the liability of
the coauthors. In the absence of a specific agreement, the coauthors
shall form an *unregistered partnership*, regulated by Sections 530 to
551 of the Swiss Code of Obligations (SCO)[^switzerland_25], the main consequence
being that all decisions are to be made unanimously (Section 534 SCO).

#### Copyright assignment

Another specificity of computer programs in comparison to other
protected works relates to the context of their creation. Most of the
time, software is developed within a company by programmers who are
employees and have in fact been hired for the purpose of developing
software. Thus, taking into consideration the tension between the
general principle of designating a natural person only as an author and
the economic need of companies investing in the software development,
the Swiss legislator has established an automatic legal assignment of
rights — absent an agreement to the contrary between the
parties — according to which only the employer is entitled to benefit
from the rights of use on a software created by the employee as part of
his/her work obligations[^switzerland_26]. The two criteria for the application of
this provision are therefore that the programmer developed the software
(i) when he/she was *at the employer’s* service and (ii) while
*performing his/her employment obligations*. This rule thus only applies
when an employment relationship in the sense of Swiss labor law exists,
and, as already mentioned, can be modified by an agreement between the
parties[^switzerland_27].

Where no employment relationship exists and the software is developed by
a self-employed programmer upon a client’s request, the determination of
the original ownership of the rights will depend on the interpretation
of the intent of the parties. Under Swiss law, to determine whether the
copyright on the created work has been assigned or whether the author
has only granted a license, one must interpret the intent of the parties
according to the theory of purpose[^switzerland_28], although in case of doubt on
the purpose, a court will favor the granting of a license instead of a
full assignment of copyright. Swiss copyright law indeed does not
incorporate the concept of “work for hire” as it exists in the USA[^switzerland_29],
and the ownership over the rights will therefore be determined on a
case-by-case basis, interpreting the intent of the parties. In the case
where it is established that only a license has been granted, the most
problematic question remains the question of exclusivity, and whether
the parties intended any license of rights to be exclusive. It is
generally admitted that exclusivity has been granted in cases where the
software incorporates trade secrets, when its development has only been
possible thanks to the client’s knowledge or when the source code has
been handed over[^switzerland_30].

*Best practices* : In light of the above, we would recommend to always
specify in writing in case of outsourced development work : (1) who will
be the author of the created software, (2) whether a license will be
granted for the created software, and (3) in such a case, whether the
license will be exclusive or not.

### Scope of protection

#### Exclusive rights

As is the case for any protected work, the author of computer software
benefits from exclusive rights over his/her work. Thus, as provided for
in Section 10 SCA, the author of computer software has the exclusive
right to decide how, when and whether his/her work shall be used[^switzerland_31].
Section 10 SCA contains an illustrative list of what is covered by this
exclusive right of use of the work[^switzerland_32]. These exclusive rights are the
patrimonial rights of the author, as opposed to his/her moral rights,
and can be freely assigned or granted to others by the author, usually
in exchange for financial compensation. The patrimonial exclusive rights
are, however, not limited to lucrative use and also cover not-for-profit
use of the work[^switzerland_33]. As regards computer programs, the most relevant
right is the right to make copies and to distribute them, which includes
online distribution according to the prevailing opinion among Swiss
authors[^switzerland_34].

#### Specific rights for computer software under Swiss law

In addition to the general patrimonial exclusive rights to which every
author is entitled under the Swiss Copyright Act, authors of computer
software benefit from two additional exclusive rights: (i) an exclusive
rental right[^switzerland_35] and (ii) a utilization right[^switzerland_36].

Under Swiss law, the right of distribution does not include the
exclusive right to rent out the protected work. Thus, only authors of
computer software may own an exclusive rental right on their created
work[^switzerland_37]. This provision means that the sale of a copy of the software
does not deprive its author of the right to rent it out, i.e. to allow a
third party to use it in exchange for financial compensation.
Consequently, and contrary to what is the case for other works protected
by copyright[^switzerland_38], the user who acquired the software is not entitled to
rent it out without infringing upon the author’s exclusive right, unless
an express license has been granted[^switzerland_39].

The second exclusive right specific to computer software is a
utilization right. Pursuant to Section 12, paragraph 2 SCA, computer
software that has been lawfully sold *can be used or sold again*. Swiss
copyright law therefore expressly protects the right of the lawful owner
of the protected software to use it[^switzerland_40]. This use is however limited by
the definition of what a lawful utilization of the software is: pursuant
to Section 17 of the Ordinance on Copyright and Neighboring Rights[^switzerland_41],
lawful utilization of computer software is utilization by the legitimate
buyer in compliance with the contractual conditions of the sale. This
specific right of utilization for computer software compensates for the
fact that the private use exception for copyrighted work does not apply
to software[^switzerland_42].

#### Moral Rights

The author of a computer program, like any author in the sense of the
Swiss Copyright Act, owns moral rights to his/her creation. This notion
covers two main exclusive rights: (i) the right to be credited as the
author of the work[^switzerland_43] and (ii) the right to the respect of the
integrity of the work[^switzerland_44]. The moral rights are strictly attached to
the personality of the author or of his/her heirs and therefore cannot
be alienated nor transferred to a third party by any means[^switzerland_45]. The
transfer of the patrimonial rights does not entail the transfer of the
moral rights.

Thus, regarding the right to paternity of the work, the author of the
work will always be entitled to be credited as the author but will also
have the right to choose to remain anonymous. The author can however
waive this right, which is often the case for employees, renouncing in
their employment contract to exercise their right to be credited for
their creation, although they remain the sole author(s) of the
work[^switzerland_46].

As regards the right to the integrity of the work, the author can always
authorize third parties to modify his/her work by contract but pursuant
to Section 11, paragraph 2 SCA, the author retains the right to oppose
any modification that would harm his/her personality. This right can be
waived by the author, but will in any case have very limited impact in
relation to computer software, since any modification of the code or of
the programming language will hardly be found to be harmful to the
author’s personality[^switzerland_47].

### Exceptions to the exclusive rights

Two provisions of the Copyright Act are to be mentioned as exceptions to
the exclusive rights.

Firstly, Section 21 SCA authorizes the lawful owner of the software to
obtain information on the software’s interfaces through the reverse
engineering of the program’s code. The reverse engineering, which can be
operated by the owner of the software or by an authorized third party,
is however limited by law to the case of obtaining necessary information
for the development or use of interoperable software and this
information cannot be disclosed to unauthorized third parties[^switzerland_48].
Thus, the reverse engineering of software is only valid under Swiss law
when the two following conditions are met: (i) the information on the
interface must be necessary for the development of interoperability, and
(ii) the reverse engineering must be operated by an authorized person,
i.e. the lawful owner of the software or a third party mandated by
him/her.

The second relevant exception to the exclusive rights of the author
resides in the right of the person authorized to use the software to
make a backup copy[^switzerland_49]. This right cannot be limited by contract, but
is limited to *one copy only*, and only belongs to the lawful user of
the software as described above[^switzerland_50]. Any copy made for any other
purpose, even by the lawful user, will be deemed an infringement on the
author’s exclusive right. The rightful user is also authorized to make
temporary copies, insofar as they are technically necessary for the
transmission of the work to a third party or for any other lawful
utilization of the work, and that they do not have any independent
economic significance[^switzerland_51].

### Term of protection

Under Swiss law, the general term for protection of copyright for
computer software is fifty (50) years after the death of the
author[^switzerland_52]. This differs from the longer term of protection for other
copyrighted works that lasts for seventy (70) years after the death of
the author.

In the case of co-authorship, the protection of the software ends fifty
(50) years after the death of the last living coauthor[^switzerland_53]. If each
coauthor’s input, however, can be separated from the rest of the work,
the protection for each separate input will end fifty (50) years after
the death of its author[^switzerland_54].

As regards to derivative work, the term of protection will differ for
the original work and for the additional creation, each part being
protected by copyright for fifty (50) years after the death of its
respective author[^switzerland_55].

### Special measures

As a signatory of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT)[^switzerland_56] and the WIPO
Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT)[^switzerland_57], Switzerland has adopted
a provision in the Copyright Act for the protection of effective
technological measures[^switzerland_58]. Pursuant to Section 39a SCA, the removal or
circumvention of effective technological measures used for the
protection of copyrighted works or other protected objects is
prohibited. Swiss law however provides for an exception to this rule:
circumventing protective technological measures will not be punished by
law if it is performed for the sole purpose of allowing an authorized
use of the protected work[^switzerland_59].

The Swiss Copyright Act makes it a criminal offence to violate the
provision on the protection of technological measures by circumventing
or removing the said effective measures for the purpose of unlawfully
using the protected work, but also by selling or offering products
allowing such actions (Section 69a SCA). The infringer, who must have
acted intentionally to be held criminally liable, will be punished by a
fine, or by imprisonment in the case that he/she is a professional
infringer. In addition, it must be noted that once an infringement to
the rules concerning the protection of technological measures occurs, a
presumption exists that it has created a threat to copyright and the
author will therefore be entitled to damages without being required to
establish any actual infringement to copyright[^switzerland_60].

## Analysis of FOSS under Swiss law

For the purpose of this chapter, the terms below will have the following
meanings:

*Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)*  
software subject to an Open Source[^switzerland_61] license granting the right to
use, analyze, modify and improve the said software by making its source
code freely available to users.

*Proprietary software*  
computer software that is the exclusive property of its
developers/publishers and which can only be copied or used in compliance
with the owner’s licensing agreements, their source code being rarely
made available.

### Common legal issues in relation with FOSS

We shall analyze in this section the legal issues regularly discussed in
relation to Open Source Software, starting with the question of
copyright protection of FOSS and then addressing the questions of
enforcement of FOSS licenses and of the consequences of a breach of such
licenses under applicable Swiss law.

### FOSS under Swiss copyright law

#### Characterization of FOSS

One major issue in relation with copyright law that takes on an
important dimension with respect to Open Source Software is the question
of characterization. Indeed, one of the legal difficulties in FOSS
consists of determining who is entitled to issue a license or to bring a
lawsuit in case of infringement, or in determining the duration of the
protection of the software. These issues can be solved by the
characterization of the Open Source Software either as a *joint work* or
as a *derivative work* as defined in the Copyright Act.

FOSS shall be considered a joint work under Swiss law when two or more
persons have worked in common on the development of original and unique
software for a determined period of time[^switzerland_62]. Thus, when several
developers have worked together for the purpose of creating original
software, the result will usually be considered a joint work in the
sense of copyright law, each developer being a coauthor.

The question becomes more complicated when unfinished software is
created and then made available under an Open Source license for the
purpose of being further developed by its users. In such cases, it will
be hard to establish that the original developer and the user worked in
collaboration with a common purpose, i.e. the creation of original
software. Thus, a common creation will rarely be found, and the software
which has been modified or improved by the user will most of the time be
considered a derivative work in the sense of Section 3 SCA. The
creator(s) of this new version of the software will therefore be a new
author (or new authors) of a new work, this characterization giving rise
to different rights.

#### Rights and obligations of the original coauthors

The coauthors of a protected work are the joint holders of the copyright
pursuant to Section 7 SCA and as such form a sui generis legal tenancy.
The co-authorship and its legal consequences will have an impact on two
main questions in relation with Open Source: (i) who is entitled to give
a license and (ii) who has the power to act in case of infringement?

As regards to the first issue, the legal regime that applies to
coauthors, which is a regime of joint tenancy imposed by law but not
defined by the legislator, implies that no assignment can be awarded nor
license granted on the software without the common consent of *all
coauthors*[^switzerland_63]. This system can be highly burdensome, especially in
relation with Open Source, where the main purpose is to make software
freely available to everyone and to allow users to benefit from further
developments. Although the strictness of this rule is partially lessened
by the obligation for all coauthors not to withhold their consent
without motive[^switzerland_64], the regime of joint ownership can be extremely
limiting, especially in the context of Open Source where it is essential
to identify the person entitled to grant the Open Source license, and
where the requirement of obtaining all the coauthors' consents would be
considered a hurdle to free distribution. The coauthors can, however,
derogate to the legal regime with a convention entitling one or several
of the coauthors to represent them all for the exercise of rights of
use.

*Best practices* : In order to escape from the burdensome legal regime
of co-authorship, we would advise authors of Open Source software to
join the Free Software Foundation (FSF) which provides a system of
assignment of the author’s copyright to the FSF, which will then be in
charge of the management of the rights[^switzerland_65].

Regarding the second issue relating to the ability to bring a claim in
case of infringement, Swiss law authorizes any coauthor to act but it
will always be on behalf of all the coauthors[^switzerland_66]. This system
facilitates the protection of the software by allowing any coauthor to
act independently on his/her own and by automatically ensuring that all
coauthors will benefit from the claim in case of a positive result. The
legal regime however does not create a similar system of solidarity in
case of a claim for infringement by a third party against the coauthors:
under Swiss law, a claim can only be brought against one coauthor and
still be valid, but the coauthor shall only be liable for his/her share
of the work — the work being divided in equal shares by the number of
coauthors without regard to the actual input of each co-author. Such a
system allows a third party to enforce its rights without having to
identify all coauthors, but it also protects each coauthor from full
liability.

#### Authors of a derivative work

The characterization of portions of Open Source software as a derivative
work will also have an impact on the rights of the author, the main
legal issue relating to his/her ability to further distribute FOSS. In
the majority of cases, the user who further develops Open Source
software, either by modifying or improving it, will be considered the
author of a derivative work and as such own a copyright on what has been
modified — inasmuch as this improvement or modification can be protected
by copyright, i.e. is original, which will usually be the case[^switzerland_67]. But
if the author wants to distribute the modified software to other users,
it is necessary to have the consent of the original author (or
coauthors) since the original work is incorporated in the derivative
one. For most FOSS licenses, the original author already consents to a
further distribution of FOSS by its users, and therefore the consent of
the original author will not be an issue (See GPL, Mozilla, etc.).
However, it may be the case that the Open Source software has been
freely distributed under a certain license that does not allow any
further distribution by the end user or any distribution of the modified
software[^switzerland_68], in which case the author of the new derivative work will
need to obtain the consent of the original developer(s) to license
his/her modified software under a new FOSS license.

#### Assignement of copyright

As we have seen in section I.3 above, the SCA provides for a special
rule regarding computer programs that are created by an employee as part
of his/her employment obligations. In such cases, although the
programmer remains the author of the protected program, the employer
will automatically own all of the exclusive rights of use on such
programs. Thus, the employer will be the entity with the authority to
validly license the software under an Open Source license, with no need
to obtain the employee’s consent[^switzerland_69]. The benefit of this rule can be
that several developers may create a company together, for which they
work and which would automatically hold the right to license the created
software, without requiring the conclusion of a convention for the
management of the rights of all coauthors for each newly created piece
of software, in this way escaping from the burdensome system of
co-authorship.

### Moral copyrights

FOSS being protected by copyright, the developer is thus an author as we
have clearly established, and as such, he/she still owns a moral
copyright on the licensed software. Therefore, the modifications or
improvements of the software, although authorized by the license, cannot
infringe upon his/her moral copyright, and more specifically cannot harm
the author’s personality[^switzerland_70]. The question of whether a modification of
the software will infringe upon the author’s personality rights will be
established on a case by case basis, and it will very rarely be found
under Swiss law in the context of computer programs[^switzerland_71]. This is even
truer in the case of FOSS, where the source code has been disclosed, and
therefore the programming language made available to all users for the
purpose of being modified. In such a context, it will be extremely
difficult to establish any harm to the developer’s personality, the only
case being when his/her reputation as a programmer would be damaged by
the subsequent modifications. Such harm will however be highly difficult
to establish in the case of FOSS, and more particularly if the software
is made available under a GPL, since this license creates an obligation
for subsequent users/modifiers to give explicit notice of their
modifications[^switzerland_72], with the consequence that the changes will not be
attributed to the original author and therefore not harm his/her
reputation. It is however important to bear in mind that the broad right
to modify the original software granted by a FOSS general license can
still be limited by the original author’s enforcement of his/her moral
right[^switzerland_73].

### Enforcement of FOSS licences

#### General contract law issues

Based on the above definition, the specificity of FOSS is that the
source code of a computer program is made freely available to users
through the delivery of a FOSS license. Yet, in order to enforce such a
license, the latter needs to have been validly concluded between the
concerned parties and its content needs to comply with the local
applicable law — which also raises questions as regards to the law
applicable to the contract and more general issues of conflict of laws
(see IV.1 below).

Assuming that the FOSS license is subject to Swiss law, the main
contract law issues in relation with FOSS would therefore relate to the
valid conclusion of the said license, the identification of the parties
to that license, as well as the validity of its content.

As a preliminary remark, it should be noted that Swiss authors generally
agree that a FOSS license should be analyzed in the context of contract
law and should not be considered to be a unilateral legal act[^switzerland_74].
Under Swiss law, a contract is defined as a bilateral or multilateral
legal act by which the parties exchange the expression of their matching
intents (meeting of the minds)[^switzerland_75]. Pursuant to that definition, a
first issue to consider is how the FOSS license is validly concluded,
i.e. how does the meeting of the minds occur?

*Conclusion of a binding contract*

Under Swiss law, it is generally admitted that a contract can be validly
concluded on the Internet, simply by clicking on a “Download” or “I
agree” button[^switzerland_76]. Therefore, a FOSS license can be validly concluded
between the author and the user when he/she downloads the Open Source
software after reading the license to which the use of the software is
subject and clicking on the “I agree” button. The FOSS license is thus
concluded between the right holder and the user by the delivery of the
software to the user or his/her access to it. The question of the
conclusion of the license is however more complicated when the software
is transferred without the user having knowledge of the FOSS license
governing it. It is indeed common that a user acquires Open Source
software without coming across the FOSS license under which the rights
are granted[^switzerland_77].

In such a case, Swiss scholars consider that the original author of FOSS
and the end user are not bound by a license or any other agreement[^switzerland_78].
The consequence of such a situation is that the user will not benefit
from the rights of the FOSS license as long as he/she is not aware of
its existence: in other words, the user will not be entitled to modify
or improve the software until he/she is bound by the conditions of the
FOSS license, with the risk arising that any unauthorized modification
of the source code will be considered to constitute copyright
infringement. Thus, should no copy of the FOSS license be communicated
to the user together with the software, then no valid license can be
concluded and therefore no modification of the software will be
considered valid and covered by the FOSS license. The content of the
FOSS license will be considered as the expression of an offer by the
licensor (i.e. the author of the software or the holder of the
copyright) to conclude an agreement governing the use of the software.
Indeed, under Swiss law, an offer in the sense of contract law does not
need to be addressed to a specific person and it can be expressly or
tacitly accepted by any recipient[^switzerland_79]. Thus, the user who complies with
the provisions and conditions contained in the FOSS license will be
considered as having validly accepted the offer and the license will be
validly concluded and binding upon the parties[^switzerland_80]. This raises however
the question of the duration of the validity of the offer and the
possibility for the licensor to withdraw such an offer. According to
Swiss scholars, the offer will remain binding upon the licensor as long
as the user has in good faith the possibility of validly concluding the
contract by the simple exercise of the conditions of use, and it will
therefore be extremely difficult for the licensor to withdraw his/her
offer and avoid the conclusion of a license agreement on the Open Source
Software[^switzerland_81].

If no license agreement has been concluded between the user and the
licensor, the modification of the software by the user could constitute
a copyright infringement, which may trigger civil as well as criminal
liability. The user’s liability, however, will most probably be reduced
or at least strongly limited in such circumstances, a Court being likely
to take into consideration the concomitant liability of the author who
did not properly attach the Open Source license to the distributed
software, therefore giving rise to legal uncertainty.

*Best Practices* : It is always recommended to accompany the software
with the FOSS general license under which it is offered to be granted,
including licenses that do not require so, in order to avoid unclear
situations where it is unsure whether a binding contract exists between
the parties, because it will otherwise depend on the interpretation of
the user’s actions to determine whether he/she intended to be bound or
not.

*Determination of the parties to the FOSS license*

Along with the question of whether a valid FOSS license has been
concluded with the transfer of the software, the other issue to be
considered in relation to Open Source is to determine who is a party to
that license agreement.

The situation is particularly complicated when the user himself/herself
starts licensing the modified software and so on. As already mentioned,
a FOSS license is always concluded between the *author* of the Open
Source software, who is the licensor, and the *user* of the software who
is the licensee. When there are several authors of the work however
(either coauthors or several authors of a derivative work), the license
must be granted by all authors and the conditions of use of the FOSS
license towards all of them will be binding upon the user. This
situation is generally solved by the license itself which will contain a
clause according to which the user, by accepting the conditions of the
license, will automatically be bound to all previous authors of the
software[^switzerland_82]. This mechanism is authorized under Swiss law and
therefore creates a valid contractual relationship between all parties.

*Violation of the FOSS license — Breach of contract or Copyright
infringement?*

The question of determining whether a violation of the FOSS license
constitutes a breach of contract or a copyright infringement may have a
certain impact in Switzerland as regards procedural issues as well as
potential remedies to which the authors may be entitled. The protection
for Open Source software can be based on both legal grounds, and the
claim will depend on the type of violation that has occurred.

Thus, the copyright holder will be entitled to invoke a copyright
infringement for the cases in which the user does not give proper credit
notice or modifies the software when he has only been given the right to
use it, whereas the claim of a user brought in order to obtain the
disclosure of the source code will only be based on contract law since
it only constitutes a breach of the license agreement and not a
copyright infringement. It is however conceivable that an action
consists of both a breach of contract and an infringement to copyright,
in which case the claimant will be able to invoke both violations and
the Court will usually have proper jurisdiction on both.

Some differences however exist between a claim based on copyright law
and a claim based on contract law, in particular from a procedural point
of view. The Swiss legal system being a federal system, a claim is
usually brought in front of a local cantonal court before ending up in
front of the Swiss Supreme Court; for copyright claims however, there is
only one unique competent jurisdiction at the cantonal level before an
appeal can be brought in front of the Swiss Supreme Court, whereas a
claim based on contract law may go through several cantonal appeals
before ending up in front of the Swiss Supreme Court[^switzerland_83].

In addition to this procedural difference, the remedies in contract law
and copyright law that would be applicable to a violation of a FOSS
license can differ in some respects, reason why the claimant will often
use both grounds in front of the court[^switzerland_84]. Indeed, although damages
can be asked both in case of copyright infringement and breach of
contract, contract law’s sole alternative remedy will be limited to
injunction for specific performance, whereas the SCA provides for more
specific remedies, such as the prohibition of further distribution of
the infringing copy and/or its destruction[^switzerland_85]. In case of copyright
infringement, the author will also be entitled to ask for a declarative
judgment of his/her quality of author[^switzerland_86], or to ask for an injunction
to prevent the infringement from happening or to make it stop in cases
where the infringement is still producing effects[^switzerland_87]. It should also
be noted that Swiss copyright law additionally makes it a criminal
offence to perform most acts of copyright infringement[^switzerland_88].

#### Warranty and Liability

As regards FOSS, there are two main aspects to be analyzed in this
section: one relates to the warranty granted or more generally excluded
by the licensor, and the second relates to the validity of a waiver of
the licensor’s liability.

*Exclusion of warranty*

Under Swiss law, the regime applicable to the exclusion of warranty will
depend on the characterization of the license that will determine the
applicable contract law rules. Swiss contract law sets out general rules
applicable to all types of contracts and specific rules regulating
specific types of contracts (“contrats nommés”)[^switzerland_89]. License agreements
are not specifically regulated under Swiss contract law but are
considered as “sui generis contracts”[^switzerland_90] and are therefore subject to
the general rules on contracts. In some instances however, a court may
apply some rules of specifically regulated agreements by analogy to a
license agreement when it is deemed appropriate[^switzerland_91], and Swiss legal
scholars have therefore identified specific rules that may be applicable
to FOSS licenses.

Although the Open Source Definition provides in the Section 1 that no
royalties or fees should be perceived by the licensor under a FOSS
license for the selling or giving away of the Open Source software[^switzerland_92],
the distribution of such software can be included in the sale of an
aggregate software which can be done against payment or a fee may be
charged for the physical act of the transfer. In such cases, Swiss
scholars have found that the rules of sales contract could be applicable
to the FOSS license, which would be subject to the limitations of the
exclusion of warranty[^switzerland_93]. Pursuant to Section 199 SCO, a clause
excluding all warranties in a sales contract is void in the case of
fraud. Thus, a clause such as Section 15 of the GNU GPL v3 or Section 11
of the GNU GPL v2 excluding all kinds of warranty could be found
non-valid under Swiss law if the transfer of the Open Source Software
incorporates elements that can be assimilated to a sales contract and
would therefore not be enforceable in cases of fraud. The invalidity of
the clause excluding all warranties will however not affect the validity
and enforceability of the rest of the license pursuant to the principle
of severability.

On the other hand, should the Open Source software be transferred
entirely free of charge, such a transfer could fall under the rules of
donation, applicable by analogy as regards to the rules on the exclusion
of warranty[^switzerland_94]. Yet, in case of a donation, Section 248, paragraph 2
SCO makes the exclusion of all warranties valid. In that context, the
provisions from the GPL mentioned above, excluding all types of
warranties would be deemed valid under Swiss law[^switzerland_95].

*Waiver of liability*

In addition to the exclusion of warranties, most FOSS licenses contain a
provision waiving all liability of the author/licensor for damages (e.g.
article 16 GNU GPLv3 & article 11 GNU GPL v2). Some of these provisions
reserve however the mandatory provisions of the applicable law[^switzerland_96].
Assuming that Swiss law is applicable to a FOSS license, the waiver of
liability would not be valid in case of fraud or gross negligence[^switzerland_97].
Any other exclusion of liability for damages resulting from the use of
the Open Source software, which is not covered by the cases of gross
negligence and fraud, shall therefore be considered valid[^switzerland_98].

#### The copyleft principle

A “copyleft” license is a license by which the licensor grants the right
to use, distribute and modify the computer program to a licensee, under
the condition that all further distributions of the modified software
make the work available in a form that facilitates further modification
and use the same license. Not all FOSS licenses are “copyleft” licenses
(for instance the BSD and the Apache licenses are not “copyleft”,
whereas the GPL and the LGPL are). In the absence of a “copyleft”
clause, a user that has modified the Open Source software is entitled to
integrate his/her new work in another program and sell it as proprietary
software, or simply to refuse access to the source code in further
distributions of the work[^switzerland_99].

One issue related to the “copyleft” principle is the question of the
compatibility of various FOSS licenses with each other. A license that
does not incorporate a “copyleft” clause can indeed be considered
incompatible with other FOSS licenses, which can lead to limitations for
the re-distribution of the software by the user[^switzerland_100]. The issue can
however be solved conventionally by a clause integrated in the Open
Source License that will determine which other Open Source licenses are
compatible and can therefore be used by the users to license their
modified version of the software[^switzerland_101].

This principle raises also other legal issues, in particular as regards
the integration of a part of Open Source software into proprietary
software : is the user under the obligation to make the full new
software available under a FOSS license or is it limited to the part of
the code developed under an Open Source license? Swiss scholars agree to
say that in such cases, the new software constitutes a derivative work
in the sense of copyright law, and therefore, the part of the code
originating from Open Source software remains subject to the conditions
of the Open Source license that has been granted by the original author.

#### Remedies — Calculation of damages in case of infringement

One of the remedies in case of breach of the FOSS license being the
possibility to claim for damages, the delicate question consists in
determining the amount of these damages.

A claim for damages, in cases of copyright infringement as well as in
cases of breach of contract, is regulated by the general rules of the
Swiss Code of Obligations (SCO). Pursuant to Section 42 SCO, the
claimant has the burden to prove the existence of a damage. The amount
of the damages corresponds to the difference between the current capital
of the claimant and the capital he/she would own if the breach had not
occurred[^switzerland_102]. In case of infringement to intellectual property rights
however, it is not always easy for the claimant to compute the claimed
damages, and Swiss law does not require him/her to file a claim stating
a precise amount[^switzerland_103]. The claimant must however provide the Court with
sufficient elements to calculate the amount of damages to award, based
on the full instruction of the case and the review of the evidence.

In cases of copyright infringement, the most common basis for a court in
computing damages is the amount of failed opportunities of the claimant
due to the copyright infringement[^switzerland_104]. It may, however, be extremely
difficult to establish that the infringement resulted in the loss of
opportunities for the copyright holder, and the amount of damages can
also be computed on the basis of the royalties that the right holder
would have received, should the protected work have been used under a
validly granted license[^switzerland_105]. In the absence of any case in relation to
Open Source software in Switzerland, it is difficult to determine in
advance which method a court would use to compute damages for the case
of a breach of a FOSS license. It would however most likely include the
judicial costs of the prevailing party, as it is common in Switzerland
for the losing party to bear the judicial costs of the adverse
party[^switzerland_106].

## FOSS case law in Switzerland

As of today, we are not aware of the reporting of any case law on FOSS
in Switzerland. A decision was rendered by the Swiss Federal
Administrative Tribunal on July 2, 2009, and later by the Swiss Federal
Tribunal on March 11, 2011[^switzerland_107] and involved, among others, Red Hat
Limited as a plaintiff in this case against the Federal Bureau for
Buildings and Logistic. This case however did not relate to any legal
issue in relation with Open Source Software but was in fact about Swiss
public procurement issues.

## Legal procedures

We will start by analyzing briefly the applicable principles of conflict
of laws that would give jurisdiction to a Swiss court and lead to the
application of Swiss law. We will then provide the reader with a short
overview of possible judicial proceedings in Switzerland in case of
infringement or breach of the FOSS license.

### Application of Swiss law pursuant to private international law (PIL)

In most cases, infringement and breach of a FOSS license will involve
foreign players located in different countries. It is therefore
important to determine (i) which court should have jurisdiction over
this case and (ii) which substantive law the court will have to apply to
the case.

Regarding the competent jurisdiction to hear the case, unless the
parties have incorporated a valid choice of court clause in the license
agreement, Section 109, paragraph 1 of the Swiss Private International
Law Act (PILA) provides that the competent court which should hear
intellectual property claims is the Swiss court at the defendant’s
domicile, or, in the absence of domicile, the court at the place where
the protection is sought. This provision designates the competent court
to hear cases of *infringement* of intellectual property right and sets
as a general rule that the Swiss courts of the domicile of the defendant
will have jurisdiction over all cases of infringement, whether there has
been an infringement on a Swiss or a foreign right[^switzerland_108]. This rule
differs in some respect with the conflict rule of the Lugano Convention
of September 16, 1988 that sets as the competent jurisdiction to hear
infringement cases, the courts of the defendant’s domicile or the court
of the place where the harmful event occurred[^switzerland_109].

In cases of a contractual breach only of the FOSS license, which does
not constitute a copyright infringement, Sections 112 and 113 PILA
provide that the court of the domicile or the habitual residence of the
defendant, or, if the defendant has no domicile or does not reside in
Switzerland, the court of the place of performance of the contract has
jurisdiction over the case.

As regards applicable law, the general principle of Swiss rules on
conflict of laws is the freedom of the parties to a binding contract to
agree upon a choice of law clause[^switzerland_110]. This general principle also
applies to contracts pertaining to intellectual property, in which a
choice of law clause is allowed[^switzerland_111], but in the absence of which the
law of the place where the grantor of the intellectual property right
has his/her habitual residence is applicable. In specific cases of
contracts pertaining to copyrights, in the absence of a choice of law
clause, the applicable law will be the law of the place where the person
having control over the server containing information has his/her
residence, and not of the place where the actual server is
located[^switzerland_112]. This rule however only applies to the contractual
obligations of the parties and a different conflict rule exists for the
questions of infringement of an intellectual property right. Pursuant to
Section 110 PILA, the law applicable to infringement cases is the law of
the State in respect of which intellectual property protection is
sought. The parties can however agree upon the application of the law of
the forum (lex fori) to damages claims *after* the harm has
occurred[^switzerland_113]. This ability for the parties to choose the lex fori is
however limited to the question of the computation of damages and does
not cover the preliminary question of infringement[^switzerland_114].

### Overview of the possible proceedings in Switzerland in case of infringement

#### Civil proceedings

On January 1st, 2011, a new unified civil procedure act came into force
in Switzerland, and all cantons are therefore subject to the same
procedural rules. The obligation for cantons to have a unique trial
court as regards to copyright claims remains in force and has be
confirmed by the new unified procedure[^switzerland_115]. This rule applies to cases
on issues of copyright infringement but also on issues of transfer of
rights or on licenses to use copyrighted work, and therefore covers
claims that could be filed in Switzerland in relation to a FOSS license.
Following a decision from the unique cantonal trial court, an appeal
will always be possible to the Swiss Supreme Court[^switzerland_116].

The filing of provisional measures in relation to copyright claims is
possible for the party that shows that a copyright infringement is
likely to have occurred or is likely to occur in the near future[^switzerland_117].
The provisional measures will usually be used for the preservation of
evidence, for discovering the origin of counterfeiting goods, but it can
also consist in the prohibition to use the contentious work, which will
probably be the most useful in software cases[^switzerland_118].

#### Criminal proceedings

Along with civil proceedings that can be initiated in case of breach of
a FOSS license, the claimant may also press criminal charges against the
potential infringer in front of a criminal court. There will be criminal
proceedings only if initiated by the right holder, unless the infringer
acted professionally in which case the judicial authorities can charge
him/her automatically, and a crime will be found only if the infringer
acted *intentionally*[^switzerland_119]. A new unified criminal procedure code also
came into force on January 1st, 2011, and is now applied by all cantons
in all criminal cases.
