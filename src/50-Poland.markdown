## Introduction to software protection under Polish law

The legal framework regarding software protection in the Republic of
Poland comprises the Constitution of 2 April 1997, acts passed by
Parliament, ratified treaties, and regulations issued by the Prime
Minister or the Council of Ministers. As far as international treaties
and agreements relating to copyright protection of computer
programs/software are concerned, the Republic of Poland has acceded[^poland_1]
to several international treaties which have the same legal effect as
the legislation directly established by Parliament.

Unsurprisingly, legal norms affording protection of software are
categorized in civil law as opposed to criminal law. However, the Polish
Criminal Code (hereinafter the CRC) provides for protection of computer
programs[^poland_2]. Copyright protection of software is regulated in Poland by
the Act on Authors' Rights and Neighbouring Rights (hereinafter the
ARNR)[^poland_3].

The ARNR is deemed *lex specialis* with regard to provisions of the
Civil Code[^poland_4]. The Polish Codification Commission preparing the 1964
draft of the Civil Code (hereinafter the CC) did consider adding the new
law on copyright to the CC, but the pragmatic view that it was best not
to disturb the existing regulations of the separate law on copyright
prevailed. Another reason to regulate this area of law outside the CC is
that, although it focuses on private law matters, it also encompasses
the closely related areas of administrative and criminal law[^poland_5].

The ARNR transposes Council Directive 91/250/EEC of 14 May 1991 on the
legal protection of computer programs[^poland_6] into Polish national law
(hereinafter the Software Directive).

In cases where international agreements to which Poland is a party
provide for a higher level of protection than is envisaged under the
ARNR, the international convention prevails. This rule is in compliance
with the Polish Constitution, which provides that international treaties
are self-executing[^poland_7]. The more beneficial rules under international
conventions apply not only to beneficiaries under the relevant
conventions, but also to works whose country of origin is Poland[^poland_8].

### Copyright: Object of protection

Copyright is defined as any expression of creative activity having
individual character and manifested in any material form, regardless of
the value, intended purpose or manner of expression thereof (the
work)[^poland_9]. Case law and the Polish legal doctrine share the view that an
immaterial work under copyright law should demonstrate all of the
following characteristics:

-   it must be the result of the activity of a person, i.e. the creator
    of the work, whereby manifestation of activity means every
    manifested result of action,

-   it must be a manifestation of creative activity,

-   it must have an individual character[^poland_10].

The ARNR provides a non-exhaustive list of works that may be subject to
automatic copyright protection[^poland_11] for which no formalities are
required. The ARNR does not require the use of copyright notices, but
such notices are very often used in order to identify protected works.
The Polish Supreme Court has repeatedly indicated that copyrighted work
can be of any kind, provided — in terms of form at least — it shows a
minimum degree of creativity[^poland_12].

Polish copyright law provides no definition of a computer program or
computer software. Computer programs are eligible for protection as
literary works. The protection granted to a computer program should
extend to all related forms of expression, including design, production
and utilisation. The ideas and principles underlying any element of a
computer program, including those underlying its interfaces, are not
protected[^poland_13].

The program interface is protected in the same way as other components
of a computer program. If it appears that information obtained through
decompilation of the interface does not allow for the development of a
substitute interface (for instance, to achieve interoperability with
other programs), then the conclusion must be that such interface is
“determined” and, therefore, it is not eligible for copyright protection
and cannot legally be transferred to another program[^poland_14]. The Supreme
Administrative Court has ruled that whether a given work is
copyrightable is not determined by the will of the contracting parties,
but by the findings of fact. A computer program cannot be copyrighted
unless the activities of its creator have the characteristics of
originality and individuality[^poland_15].

## Authors/Beneficiaries

Copyright belongs to the creator, unless otherwise stated by law. The
creator should be that person whose name is clearly marked on the copies
of the work or whose authorship has in any other way been brought to the
notice of the public in connection with the disclosure of the work.

Insofar as the creator has not revealed his authorship, he should be
replaced in the exercise of his copyright by the producer or publisher,
and in their absence by the appropriate organization for the collective
administration of authors' rights[^poland_16].

Joint creators should have joint ownership of copyright and their shares
are presumed equal. Each joint creator may demand to have the size of
the shares determined by a court of law in proportion to the individual
contributions of creative work. Each of the joint creators may exercise
the copyright in that part of the work created by him, provided said
part has intrinsic value, but without prejudice to the rights of the
other joint creators. Exercising copyright in the overall work requires
approval from all the creators. In the absence of such agreement, each
creator may seek resolution of the dispute in court[^poland_17], which should
reach a decision taking the interests of all the joint creators into
consideration. Each of the joint creators may bring action claiming
violation of copyright in relation to the whole work. Sums won in such
action are awarded to the creators depending on their share of the
copyrighted work. The provisions on joint ownership[^poland_18] apply similarly
to the economic rights of joint creators[^poland_19].

Where the creators have assembled their separate works with a view to
joint distribution, each may demand permission from the other(s) to
distribute the entire work, except where there is a valid reason for
refusing such permission or where the contract between them provides
otherwise[^poland_20].

The economic rights in a collective work, particularly those in an
encyclopaedia or periodical publication, should accrue to the producer
or editor, whereas the rights in the separate parts of the work that
have intrinsic value should accrue to the creators thereof. The right to
the title is deemed to belong to the producer or publisher[^poland_21].

### Exclusive rights

Copyright is deemed as an absolute right that protects the spiritual and
material interests of the creator connected with his/her work.
Traditionally, there are two groups of the so-called author’s rights:
personal rights and economic rights. The economic rights of a computer
program/software consist of:

-   the right to reproduce the program in its entirety or in part,
    either permanently or over a fixed period, by any means and in any
    form; where the installation/loading, display, running, transmission
    or storage of a computer program calls for such reproduction, those
    acts should not require the consent of the owner of rights;

-   the right to translate, adapt, arrange or in any other way transform
    a computer program, without prejudice to the rights of the person
    who makes such modifications;

-   the right to distribute the original or copies of a computer program
    to the public, including rental or lending. The first sale of a copy
    of the program made by the owner of the rights or with his consent
    cause the right of distribution for that particular copy to lapse,
    without prejudice to the right to monitor any subsequent rental or
    lending of a computer program or of copies thereof[^poland_22].

### Exemptions to exclusive rights

Exceptions to the author’s monopoly are usually accepted because of the
public interest in free access to creativity[^poland_23]. The provisions on
exercising copyrights that apply to computer programs are very
restrictive, compared to those applying to other objects of copyright
protection. The following acts should not require authorization from the
owner of rights:

-   the making of a backup or reserve copy, provided such copy is
    necessary for using a computer program; unless otherwise provided in
    the contract, the copy may not be used at the same time as the
    computer program;

-   analysis and study, as well as experimentation with the operation of
    a computer program by the person authorized under the contract to
    make use of a copy of the program, in order to ascertain its
    underlying ideas and principles, provided the person concerned
    performs the above acts in conjunction with the
    installation/loading, display, running, transmission or storage of
    the computer program;

-   reproduction of the code or translation of its form where that is
    essential for obtaining the information required for achieving
    interoperability between an independently created computer program
    and other programs, provided that the following conditions are
    met: (a) the acts are performed by the licensee, or by another
    person enjoying the right to use the copy of a program, or, by a
    person authorized to do so on their behalf; (b) the information
    required for achieving interoperability is not already easily and
    rapidly accessible to the persons referred to under (a); (c) the
    acts are confined to those parts of the original program that are
    required for achieving interoperability.

-   The information mentioned above may not be:

    -   used for purposes other than for achieving the interoperability
        of the independently created computer program,

    -   communicated to other persons, except where essential to the
        interoperability of the independently created computer program,

    -   used for the development, production or marketing of a computer
        program of essentially similar form, or for any other act in
        violation of the copyright.

Contractual provisions contrary to these exceptions are deemed null and
void. The ARNR makes no distinction between physical distribution and
online distribution of computer programs. All the above-mentioned
exemptions apply to all types/kinds of software, irrespective of the way
in which it is received.

+ Computer software is excluded from so-called “personal use”
provisions, which grant the user the right to a copyrighted work without
having to obtain consent from the copyright holder[^poland_24].

### Moral rights

According to the provisions of the Polish law, personal rights or moral
rights protect the bond between the creator and the work. This bond is
not limited in time or susceptible to renunciation or assignment, in
particular with regard to the creator’s right to claim authorship of the
work and to make the work appear under his name or pseudonym, or to make
his anonymous work available to the public. However, the right to make
changes to the work (to supervise one’s work), the right to safeguard
the content and form of the work and its proper use, and the right to
control the work’s manner of use do not apply to computer programs[^poland_25].

### Term of protection

The economic rights lapse on expiry of a period of seventy years,
calculated:

(1) from the death of the creator, and in the case of works of joint
authorship from the death of the last surviving joint creator,

(2) from the date of first publication if the creator is not known, and
if the work has not been published, from its production in material
form, unless — before that period expires — the name of the creator has
been revealed with his consent,

(3) from the date of first publication if the economic rights belong by
operation of law to a person other than the creator himself, and if the
work has not been published, from its production in material form[^poland_26].

### Copyright assignment

An employer whose employee has created a work under an employment
contract acquires, on accepting the work, the economic rights of the
work developed during employment, as contractually agreed by the
parties.

If, within two years of acceptance of the work, the employer does not
proceed with disclosure of the work as contractually agreed, the creator
may grant the employer in writing a sufficient period of time for such
disclosure. If that period expires to no avail, the rights acquired by
the employer revert to the creator and the material object in which the
work is embodied becomes the creator’s property, unless the contract
provides otherwise. The parties are free to contractually agree on their
own disclosure period.

Unless otherwise provided in the contract, the economic rights in a
computer program created by an employee during his or her employment
belong to the employer[^poland_27]. This provision has specific nature and
should not therefore be interpreted broadly. For instance, if computer
software is created under a contract similar to an employment agreement
(or any other contract such as a commission or work for hire), all
copyrights remain with the creator, unless the contract stipulates
otherwise.

## Unprotected software and public domain software

As set forth above, only software that is original enjoys copyright
protection. Non-original software is not eligible for copyright
protection.

## Analysis of FOSS under Polish law

### The issue of free documentation

Polish law has not yet extensively handled the issue of software
documentation not released under a free licence. Under German law for
instance, as has been mentioned by legal commentators, provisions may be
invoked under which an author acting in good faith may not refuse to
allow the processing of documentation. However, there is a lack of
support for this interpretation in Polish law, due to exclusion of the
rule which states that, without the consent of the creator, a legal
successor may not make any alterations to the work except where they are
dictated by an obvious necessity and where the creator has no valid
reason to object to them[^poland_28]. This should apply by analogy to works in
which the economic rights have expired[^poland_29].

### The laws applicable to the distribution of copyrighted works

While analyzing the specific provisions of the GPL governing the
distribution of copyrighted works, the issue of the waiver of rights
arises. Polish copyright law has adopted the concept of dualistic
author’s rights (i.e. personal and economic rights), which includes the
copying right. The waiver would be a consequence of a unilateral legal
act that is communicated to the public by an author/creator. In the case
of the GPL, the author/creator makes his software available under the
GPL, thereby waiving all his rights in that particular work.
Concurrently, Polish law contains provisions that conflict with the
concept of waiving rights. Hence the conclusion is as follows: it is
impossible to waive the right to remuneration[^poland_30] (among the author’s
economic rights) and then waive all other economic rights. There is also
a prohibition on transferring economic rights for types of exploitation
not known at the time the contract is concluded; another argument that
economic rights cannot be waived under the Polish copyright law[^poland_31].

### Concept of civil partnership

The legal nature of joint activity performed by people who are
developing open source software has also been analyzed and treated as a
unique form of civil partnership[^poland_32]. This follows from the conclusion
that individuals who contribute to the development of open source
software work together as a quasi-civil partnership[^poland_33]. One of the
requirements is that the partners undertake to achieve a joint economic
purpose[^poland_34]. However, as has been observed, the contractual obligation
to support the goal of a civil partnership[^poland_35] does not arise by merely
downloading open source software from the Internet. Moreover, no legal
obligations are incurred by altering software for personal use[^poland_36].

### Contract of donation or a sales contract

Ways of receiving open source software have been analyzed in order to
determine whether it should be categorized as a donation or a sales
contract, or whether it is an *ex-parte* action[^poland_37]. Undoubtedly,
computer programs/ software are deemed economic assets of a given value
and are treated as a different kind of “goods”[^poland_38]. The nature of a
program allows it to be regarded as the autonomous subject-matter of the
contract/licence[^poland_39]. So one must distinguish between the act of
receiving software, and the licensing/contractual issues that focus on
actual use of the software. First, a distinction is made between the act
of acquiring a software program and the legal implications of such act
(gaining possession) on the one hand, and the acquisition of a wide
range of rights (of use/distribution, etc.) in the software under a
licence agreement on the other[^poland_40].

Attention has to be drawn to two distinct steps: (i) acquisition of the
actual program, and (ii) acquisition of the relevant rights. The first
step may take place by legally downloading the open source software,
permitting limited use of the software as indicated by the provisions of
Article 75(1) and (2) of the ARNR. [^poland_41]. This is a *sui generis*,
relatively obligatory, statutory licence. To date, the terms and
conditions of open source software licences are not part of the legal
relationship between an authorized user and the proprietor of the
software.\]. A licence agreement applies later on, when the user starts
to use the software[^poland_42]. The separate nature and chronological order of
these agreements are in relation to the user’s familiarization with the
provisions of the agreement[^poland_43].

The sole authorization to download the program can be characterized as a
donation of property (the property of the proprietor of the program). It
has been discussed whether in such cases an independent contract has to
be concluded for the acquisition of the program, which is separate from
the licence agreement and precedes it, and whether such an agreement
should be treated as a donation agreement[^poland_44]. There is a statutory
requirement that in order to maintain its validity, a donation agreement
has to be issued in notarized form as a deed documenting the will of the
donor[^poland_45]. However, the opposite may also be argued: a donation
agreement is valid without notarization if the promised performance has
been rendered[^poland_46]. Most convincing is the argument pointing out that a
donation is made at the expense of a donor — namely the permanent
depletion of the substance of the donor’s property. This is not the case
as far as free software is concerned. The logical conclusion is that an
anonymous contract is concluded between the proprietor of the software
and the user who downloads/acquires it[^poland_47]. It should be emphasized
that under Polish law, free transfer of ownership of a tangible medium
containing open source software (DVD, CD — the so-called *corpus
mechanicum*) is without a doubt a contract of donation. The provisions
of Article 75(1) and (2)[^poland_48] of the ARNR govern specific forms of
software exploitation, and so it is unnecessary to issue a software
licence in the shape of either an agreement or a unilateral legal act.

### The specificity of FOSS licences under Polish law

#### Software as a subject of FOSS licences

After some deliberation, Polish legal doctrine acknowledged that the
existence of open source licences is based on the assumption that this
kind of software uses copyright protection[^poland_49]. This is nothing new,
because even though Stallman himself once strongly criticized the notion
of intellectual property (IP), he also supports the main principles of
copyright law[^poland_50]. It is widely acknowledged that all GPL licences are
built upon the framework of copyright law. As was once said, “to stay
free, software must be copyrighted and licensed”[^poland_51] — assuming that
the program can be copyright protected i.e. that it is a creative work
of individual nature as defined by Polish law. It should also be
mentioned that there is no presumption that the results of actions/works
are copyright protected, unless counter-proof is furnished[^poland_52].

#### The owner/licensor/employee as a subject of FOSS licences

The basic issue is to determine who is entitled to the economic author’s
rights (right to copy etc.) as the primary copyright owner, and whether
these rights can also be enjoyed by successors in title[^poland_53]. Copyright
is vested in the creator/author (creators/authors) at the time of the
creation of the work — this principle is transferred to computer
programs. The situation is different with employees' works — copyright
is passed to the employer *ex lege*.

An employer using open source software to which one of his employees has
made changes should make the altered software available on the same
terms on which the original software was distributed and licensed[^poland_54].

In this case, the issue of payment for making changes to the program is
not recognized as a fee for the licence or for the transfer of rights in
the software, but only as remuneration for the employee’s work[^poland_55].

Software copyright cannot be encumbered or restricted if a program is
distributed/published under an open source licence by an authorized
person (successor) at the time when such person holds all the rights in
the wake of general succession.

#### Legal issues on co-authorship

The situation regarding ownership of the program is more complicated
when an undefined number of persons is involved in working on the
program. The following questions may arise: who is the author, and how
does someone come to be regarded as the author? This is certainly the
outcome of the bazaar approach in developing FOSS. The concept of
co-authorship was adopted with the in casu legal construction of
“combined work”[^poland_56]. However, this situation poses certain problems
relating to, *inter alia*, the exercising of the copyright in the whole
work, because that should require the agreement of all the joint
creators. In the absence of such agreement, each joint creator may seek
settlement of the dispute by a court, which should rule taking the
interests of all the joint creators into consideration[^poland_57]. In any such
case the principle of a majority vote cannot be applied, and the only
effective solution to this problem may be a Fiduciary Licence
Agreement[^poland_58].

#### Minors and FOSS

FOSS is and should be used by minors[^poland_59] but there are some important
issues to be considered. The Civil Code requires the consent of a
guardian to acts done by a minor[^poland_60]. As a rule the licensee may be a
minor and the minor may also accept a donation, but without creating any
encumbrance on the minor’s part[^poland_61]. The question arises however as to
whether the minor can effectively participate in the development of open
source software, and whether under Polish law the distribution of FOSS
should be limited to adults only[^poland_62]. Unfortunately, Polish law and
legal doctrine have failed to make a more thorough analysis of the legal
issues relating to the participation of minors in using and developing
free software. Allowing a minor to exercise the privileges of an open
source licence is justified by the concept that permission from his or
her statutory representative has been issued implicitly (by
implication), a general assumption in the sphere of legal actions
relating to the use of free software[^poland_63]. This issue is also very
interesting in view of the fact that work or other paid activities may
only be performed by a child under the age of 16 for the benefit of an
entity that is involved in cultural, artistic, sporting or advertising
activities, and only with the prior consent of his or her statutory
representative or guardian as well as permission from the competent
labour inspectorate[^poland_64].

#### Concluding individual FOSS licences under Polish law

An agreement is concluded when an offer[^poland_65] is submitted and then
accepted[^poland_66]. Such an agreement has many unusual characteristics[^poland_67]
indicated by the manner in which the contract is concluded. A statement
is made offering non-exclusive rights to every user, so an offer is
directed to all (*ad incertas personas*) to use the work (the
reproduction, distribution, alteration rights, etc.). It is considered a
definite offer to conclude a contract when the author or other entitled
party makes software available under similar conditions and enables the
downloading of a program. This is not considered a typical invitation to
call for bids (*invitatio ad offerendum*[^poland_68]). The offer to conclude an
agreement may also be submitted in other circumstances, i.e. if there is
a third party between the offeror (licensor) and offeree (licensee), and
if such third party is deemed a messenger or representative who provides
information about the contract offer[^poland_69].

The individual contract is not concluded on commencing use of the
software, but when distribution of the program begins. The user accepts
the offer by performing such actions as modification or
distribution[^poland_70]. It is not important for the conclusion of the
contract that the licensor has to receive an approval message[^poland_71]. This
is implicit conclusion of a contract performed. There is also the issue
of how to assess the nature of distribution of a computer program that
is based on an order placed by a potential user by e-mail. It is assumed
that this constitutes the conclusion of an agreement to transfer
intangible rights that has the characteristics of a contract of donation
or an innominate contract, to which the statutory regulations pertaining
to donation agreements should apply. Article 75(1) of the ARNR regulates
the permissible exploitation of the program.

#### The characteristics of an individual open source licence

This is an individual non-exclusive licensing agreement[^poland_72]. The rights
to use open source software are provided on a resolutive condition[^poland_73].

#### The scope of rights/content of FOSS licences under Polish law

It has been discussed whether the scope of rights under the GPL2 can be
extended to the lease right that is not explicitly mentioned in this
licence. The popular opinion issued by J. Marly[^poland_74] has also been
accepted by Polish legal commentators[^poland_75]. As regards the distribution
right, it has been agreed that this right may be exercised under a
donation contract or a special form of innominate contract, but
definitely not under a sales agreement[^poland_76].

#### Obligations

The program’s author or developer is required to grant non-exclusive
rights free of charge. There is a conflict here with the copyright of
works created during an employment relationship, because under statutory
regulations the entitled party is *ex lege* the employer. As already
mentioned, the issue of copyleft also conflicts with the provisions of
the Civil Code concerning minors[^poland_77].

#### Termination of license contract

The licence expires *ex nunc* if the licensee violates the conditions of
Section 4 of the GPLv2. This means that continued use/exploitation
constitutes a violation of absolute copyright laws. However, this does
not grant entitlement to assert the claims provided for such cases when
Article 75 of the ARNR is applied. The problem of the principle of
exhaustion of rights arises. If it is assumed that a licence agreement
is not disposable, then the provisions of Article 365$^1$ of the CC
should be applied[^poland_78]. However, under Polish law the nullity of a legal
action involving the termination or rescission of a licence agreement
has to be considered, taking into account the rules on open source
movement, if a licence agreement is terminated or a unilateral licence
is withdrawn without the provisions of such agreement having been
infringed by the licensee. This would be a declaration of will that is
clearly contrary to the rules of social coexistence as defined in
Article 58 § 2 of the CC[^poland_79]. If this interpretation is not feasible,
an alternative would be to invoke the abuse of rights by the holder of
the open source software[^poland_80].

#### Distribution of open source software by 3rd parties

The messenger[^poland_81] who passes on an offer, as defined in the GPL and
submitted by the author or producer of open source software, is regarded
in Polish law as being the distributor of the open source software. In
any such case, the offer is accepted *per facta concludentia* (both
parties have voluntarily started to render their contractual
performance) by starting the exploitation of the program[^poland_82]. A legal
relationship is then brought about between the author/entitled person
and a third party (distributor). The parties may be bound by any of the
following contractual relationships: a licence agreement for
reproduction, distribution and circulation; a sub-licence agreement; a
sales contract; a consignment agreement; or an agency contract[^poland_83].

#### Breach of the conditions of FOSS licence

Any breach of the licence automatically renders it void. However,
termination in this manner will not affect the interests and rights of
third parties if they acquired the right to use the software from the
party who violated the licence. The question arises as to whether the
party who violates the GPL also loses the status of “the lawful user of
the program”. i.e. the party entitled to use a copy of the program,
meaning that it is not allowed to exercise the rights conferred by
Article 75 of the ANRN. After obtaining a program released under an open
source licence/GPL, this applies both to the stage following conclusion
of the licence agreement and to the stage preceding conclusion of an
individual contract under the provisions of the GPL. Any violation of
the GPL beyond the permitted limits effectively terminates not only the
agreement itself, but also the ability to use the program[^poland_84].

The conditions of the GPL are also breached if software is installed on
embedded systems where the source code is not made available/shared,
and/or if a written offer to supply the software has not been
released/submitted[^poland_85]. If an open source licence agreement is
breached, all the claims relating to copyright infringement may be
asserted. The entitled party whose economic rights have been infringed,
may demand that the person infringing these rights:[^poland_86]

1) put an end to the infringement;

2) eliminate the consequences of the infringement;

3) compensate the losses:

a) either on the basis of general principles[^poland_87], or

b) by paying a sum of money equal to twice — or, if the infringement is
culpable, three times — the equitable remuneration, which at the time of
enforcement would be due to the entitled party in return for granting
permission to use the work;

4) surrender any benefits received.

Regardless of the aforementioned claims, the entitled party may demand:

1) a one-off or repeated press announcement of appropriate content and
form, or (part) publication of the court ruling in the case at issue, in
accordance with the court’s specifications;,

2) payment by the infringer of an appropriate sum of money, not less
than twice the amount of the benefit attained by the infringing party,
to the Fund for the Promotion of Artistic Creation, if the infringement
is culpable and occurred during business activities carried out in the
infringer’s own name or for third-party account.

Each of the joint creators may bring action claiming violation of
copyright in relation to the whole work[^poland_88]. The FSFE’s Fiduciary
Licence Agreement is a perfect solution for all problems connected with
co-authorship and joint ownership[^poland_89].

#### FOSS licences and private international law

The provisions of standard open source licence are within the limits and
scope of contractual freedom as adopted in civil law in Article 353$^1$
of the CC[^poland_90]. In accordance with the provisions of the Polish Act of
12 November 1965 on Private International Law (hereinafter the PIL), in
the absence of the choice of law, an obligation is subject to the law of
the state in which the contract was concluded[^poland_91].

Interpreting the provisions of Article 7 of the PIL, it may be argued
that Polish law applies to contracts/agreements permitting use of open
source software in Poland[^poland_92]. It may also be assumed that a
contract/agreement on using open source software is brought about on
saving the software to the computer memory, and in conjunction with the
provisions of Article 70 § 2 of the CC[^poland_93] the conclusion is that the
location of the computer determines the location of the conclusion of
the contract[^poland_94].

#### FOSS licences and consumer law

The GPL has been the subject of analysis from the point of view of
Polish consumer law. The first important issue to be raised is the fact
that only the English-language version is legally binding[^poland_95]. This
situation makes the GPL subject to application of the provisions of the
Act of 7 October 1999 on the Polish Language[^poland_96]. According to Article
7 of the Act, all contracts to which a Polish entity is a party and
which are to be executed on Polish territory must be written in Polish.
Although versions of such contracts may also exist in a foreign
language, the Polish version of the contract prevails for interpretation
purposes, unless the parties expressly stipulate otherwise in the
contract. The Act explicitly forbids using a foreign language version of
a contract to provide evidence of the contract’s existence. This means
that in a dispute before a Polish court, parties to a contract executed
only in a foreign language are denied the right to furnish evidence to
prove the existence of the contract. For goods and services, all product
manuals and specifications, terms and conditions of warranties,
invoices, bills and receipts must be in Polish. The Act requires the
names of merchandise to be in Polish, although individually designated
names, brands and trademarks — despite their foreign wording — do not
have to have Polish equivalents. The Act requires that offers,
advertisements and descriptions of merchandise and services which are in
a foreign language be accompanied by a Polish translation[^poland_97]. If the
obligations laid down in Article 7 of the Act are violated, the relevant
provisions of Article 74 § 1 sentence 1 and 74 § 2 of the CC apply[^poland_98].

This does not imply the invalidity of such an agreement, but it has an
effect in the sphere of evidence — *ad solemnitatem*[^poland_99]. The documents
referred to in Article 7 also relate to standard contract forms, and
that is what the GPL and other open source model licences undoubtedly
are[^poland_100].

The obligation to use the Polish language cannot be eliminated by
indicating that the applicable law is other than Polish law[^poland_101].
Polish courts are obliged to apply the provisions of Articles 7 and 8 of
the Act on Polish language[^poland_102]. Thus a Polish court is bound to settle
any dispute arising from the contractual provisions by invoking the
restriction pursuant to Articles 7 and 8, which will always be applied
even if under Polish Private International Law the law governing the
standard contract form is foreign law[^poland_103].

The issue of concluding an open source licence/contract has been
analyzed from the point of view of the protection of consumer interests,
based on the provisions of Act of 27 July 2002 on Specific Terms and
Conditions of Consumer Sale and Amendments to the Civil Code[^poland_104].
However, the application of these provisions has been questioned, due to
the fact that this Act should be applied to the sale — in the context of
an enterprise’s business activities — of a movable chattel/tangible
asset to a natural person who purchases the item for a purpose other
than carrying out professional work or business (consumer goods)[^poland_105].

Another aspect of consumer law is the analysis of contractual provisions
of open source licences in terms of distance dealing, and the provisions
of the Act of 2 March 2000 on the Protection of Consumer Rights and
Liability for Damage Caused by a Dangerous Product (hereinafter the
PRCLL)[^poland_106]. Such contracts are concluded in a situation where the two
parties are not simultaneously present in one place, and methods or
means of distance communication — including electronic means of
communication within the meaning of Article 2 pt. 5 of the Polish Act of
18 July 2002 on Providing Services by Electronic Means — PSEM — (in
Polish: ustawa o świadczeniu usług drogą elektroniczną)[^poland_107] — are used
to conclude the agreement. Downloading a program from the Internet that
is distributed under the GPL satisfies the conditions of a
contract/agreement/licence concluded at a distance. The application of
these laws is limited due to the fact that the consumer is acting as
licensee, whilst the other party is the entrepreneur/professional entity
doing business operations. The burden of proof that an agreement has
been concluded at a distance lies with the consumer.

+ In addition, if the open source licence/agreement/contract is
concluded at a distance and is subject to regulations laid down in the
PRCLL, other legal standards provided in this Act may be applicable. The
rights of the consumer may not be excluded or limited under a contract,
even where foreign law has been chosen[^poland_108]. A consumer who concludes a
distance contract may withdraw from it without giving reasons, by
issuing a written statement to that effect within a period of ten days
after conclusion of the contract[^poland_109]. This right is not conceded in
the provisions of the GPL, but this does not have any serious legal
implications[^poland_110].

#### FOSS licences and model contracts

The general terms of licence agreements on open source software, such as
the GPL, satisfy the conditions for applying the provision laid down in
Article 384 of the CC[^poland_111] and are deemed “previously formulated
contractual terms”. There is no special treatment for general licence
terms drawn up as standard contracts with international scope[^poland_112]. The
provisions of Articles 384-3854 of the CC are applied regardless of the
nature of the contract, and no matter whether the contract/agreement is
paid or free of charge.

Polish law also distinguishes recognition of a standard contract from
the question of its approval and inclusion in the wording of an
individual agreement on using a software program. This is not precluded
by the fact that the standard contract is drawn up in English[^poland_113]. The
provisions of Article 385 §2 of the CC require only that the standard
contract be formulated explicitly and clearly.

Polish legal doctrine favours liberal and flexible interpretation of the
term “delivery/service” of a standard contract following its conclusion,
under provisions laid down in Article 384 §1 of the CC in conjunction
with Article 384 §4 of the CC. The provisions of a standard contract are
implemented in an individual agreement at the time of its
conclusion[^poland_114].

However, general acknowledgement that the terms of the GPL effectively
apply in Poland, does not rule out doubts and questions regarding the
effectiveness of certain provisions of the GPL[^poland_115]. It has also been
noted that the abusive nature of these provisions is subject to specific
presumption[^poland_116].

## Tax law

The Polish tax system is divided mainly into tax on earnings and tax on
turnover[^poland_117].

### Tax on legal entities and private income

The Polish Undersecretary of State has issued an opinion[^poland_118] regarding
tax consequences associated with the use of free software programs. The
circular was addressed to the directors of all tax offices and chambers
in order to ensure uniform application of the law under Article 14 § 1
no. 2 of the Tax Code and convey an explanation of Article 12(1) no. 2
of the Polish Act of 15 February 1992 on Legal Entities' Income Tax
(hereinafter the LEIT)[^poland_119].

The opinion stated that in the case of rights obtained free of charge,
income is determined on the basis of prices used in market sales of
similar rights, in particular in terms of their condition and degree of
use and the time and place of such use. Tax law provisions establishing
the value of taxable income for performance received gratuitously do not
foresee a situation where such performance is free for all stakeholders.
Article 12(6) of the LEIT covers cases where the value of gratuitous
performance can be compared to other paid performance by the taxpayer.
The value of “comparable” performance of a given kind — in this case, of
free software that is available to all on an equal
(free-of-charge/gratuitous) basis — cannot be determined, and so there
is no basis for ascertaining earnings. If certain performance (including
the transfer of rights) is inherently free-of-charge to all taxpayers,
and not an individual case applying to a single entity, establishing
taxable income from such performance is not permitted pursuant to
Article 12(1)(ii) of the LEIT. This does not mean, however, that in
assessing the possible tax consequences associated with the use of such
software, there is no need to examine all the circumstances connected
with it. Each case therefore requires individual analysis. This
explanation of the tax consequences associated with using free software
applies to individuals engaged in non-agricultural business operations
who are liable to income tax[^poland_120].

### Tax on civil law transactions

The Tax Office in Tarnowskie Góry[^poland_121] has ruled that the unconditional
free sharing of a computer program with unlimited recipients is not a
civil law act, and that donations sent to its creators by users of the
program are not a form of payment for its use. There is therefore no
legal relationship between the creators of the program and its users,
and no rights are transferred by the creator to the user, and so this
form of activity is not liable to tax on civil law transactions[^poland_122].

### Tax on goods and services (VAT)

The Tax Office in Chorzów[^poland_123] has ruled that publishing a computer
program free of charge in the Internet, enabling it to be used by
anyone, is not necessarily based on any legal title incurring the
obligation to provide service and demand payment, and that the amount of
donations does not depend on the actual service provided, and so this
act is not deemed performance for remuneration. Furthermore, the Office
has ruled that there is no reason to believe that such actions are
services provided free-of-charge, and so they are not subject to tax on
goods and services[^poland_124].

The above-mentioned position of the Polish tax authorities is
undoubtedly beneficial to those involved in the production and use of
free software. In principle, it also includes closed source software,
because that primarily concerns software that is distributed “free of
charge” and not the rights granted to users. Of course, it must be
remembered that interpretations by the tax authorities do not apply
universally and are not binding: they are merely issued with regard to a
specific taxpayer and the circumstances relating to that taxpayer[^poland_125].

## FOSS and legal issues of open standards

Polish administrative courts have ruled that requests concerning access
to public information relating to open standards may be excluded,
because protection of secrecy (other than state secrets) is a matter for
the civil courts and not subject to administrative jurisdiction[^poland_126].
The civil courts have held that in accordance with the obligation to
disclose public information laid down in Article 13 of the Act on the
Informatization of Activities Undertaken by Entities Fulfilling Public
Tasks[^poland_127], the President of the Social Insurance Institution
(hereinafter the ZUS, in Polish: Zakład Ubezpieczeń Społecznych) has to
disclose public information concerning the technical specifications of
the KSI MAIL format that is used in Płatnik software[^poland_128].

## FOSS cases in Poland

No cases have been reported so far (April 2014).

## Legal procedures

Copyright holders in the Republic of Poland may protect their rights in
civil and criminal proceedings. Moreover, they may also resort to
procedure before the customs authorities. The Republic of Poland is not
a common law country and the courts are not bound by the decisions of
other courts. However, Polish judges tend to recognize widely the
decisions and verdicts of the Polish Courts of Appeal and the Polish
Supreme Court. Only rulings by the Supreme Court that are issued as a
legal norm are universally binding. The decisions of foreign bodies such
as the General Court and Court of Justice of the EU may be recognized
only as so-called “persuasive precedents”.

Action for infringement of copyright is brought before a District Court
in the first instance. There are no special courts which have exclusive
jurisdiction for resolving copyright disputes, except for matters
relating to the criminal prosecution of copyright infringement. These
cases are brought before the regional courts located in cities where
particular district courts are also seated. The litigation costs depend
on the amount in dispute.

## Protection of databases

Poland has also adopted *sui generis* protection for databases in a
separate law, entitled the Act on Protection of Databases (hereinafter
the APD)[^poland_129]. The Polish Supreme Court has held[^poland_130] that acquiring
an electronic database and selling it to customers under a different
name is a tortious act of unfair competition.[^poland_131]

[^poland_33]: The civil partnership is the simplest form of conducting business
    by two or more entrepreneurs. This form has no legal personality and
    its functions are governed by contract law (Articles 860-875 of the
    Civil Code). Partners of civil partnership are subject of rights.
    The partnership itself is only a contract and does not constitute an
    independent legal entity. The consequence of lack of legal
    personality is that a partnership does not own property. All rights
    and obligations are contracted on behalf of partners and fall to
    their common property. Partners have the asset which constitutes
    their joint ownership of the total.

[^poland_34]: Article 860 of the CC § 1 By a deed of partnership, the partners
    shall undertake to promote the attainment of a common economic
    objective by acting in a specified manner and, in particular, by

    act of unfair competition shall be the activity contrary to the law
    or good practices which threatens or infringes the interest of
    another entrepreneur or customer. (2) The acts of unfair competition
    shall be in particular: misleading designation of the company, false
    or deceitful indication of the geographical origin of products or
    services, misleading indication of products or services,
    infringement of the business secrecy, inducing to dissolve or to not
    execute the agreement, imitating products, slandering or dishonest

    of the CUC (1) Imitating a finished product by way of technical
    means of reproduction, to copy an external image of such product
    where it may mislead customers as to the identity of the producer or

    functional features of a product, in particular its make, structure
    and form ensuring its usefulness shall not be deemed the act of
    unfair competition. Where the imitation of functional features of a
    finished product requires including its characteristic form, which
    may mislead customers as to the producer or product identity, the
    imitator is under obligation to adequately mark the product.
