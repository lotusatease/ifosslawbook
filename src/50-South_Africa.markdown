## Introduction to Software Protection under South African Law

### Body of Law

The law affecting rights and control over computer programs is
essentially statutory. Rights in software in South Africa arise
primarily from the Copyright Act[^south_africa_1]. Historically South African
copyright legislation and judicial interpretation of copyright
legislation have been influenced by British law. Software is in theory
not patentable in South Africa[^south_africa_2], but since South Africa registers
patents without substantive examination patents over software have been
registered[^south_africa_3]. Although these patents are in principle void it is
necessary to approach a court to declare them void thus they have some
effect in practice.

Apart from copyright and patent legislation rights to computer programs
are most affected by the common law of contract. South Africa is a Roman
Dutch common law jurisdiction[^south_africa_4] in which the principles underlying the
common law of contract and property are based upon the 'ius civilis’in a
way analogous to Scotland. It is worth noting that South Africa has a
fully justiciable Bill of Rights which includes socio-economic rights
and enables the enforcement of fundamental rights against non-State
actors. The Constitutional Court has refused to recognize a right to
intellectual property as a fundamental right.[^south_africa_5]

### Copyright Act: Object of Protection

Computer programs are the subject of copyright protection as a
specifically designated category of work. A computer program is defined
as a set of instructions which when used directly or indirectly in a
computer, directs its operation to bring about a result’[^south_africa_6]. Both
subject and object code therefore fall within the definition of computer
program. A program need not function correctly to be eligible for
copyright protection[^south_africa_7]. The definition of literary works explicitly
excludes computer programs. However preparatory materials such as flow
charts do not fall within the definition of computer program and are
therefore protected as literary works. Other categories of works such as
cinematographic films are defined so as to exclude computer
programs[^south_africa_8].

To be eligible for copyright a computer program must be reduced to
material form[^south_africa_9]. Recording as ‘digital data’ meets the requirement.
Copyright is regarded as an immovable intangible[^south_africa_10].

### Copyright Holders

The holder of the exclusive rights of copyright is referred to as the
owner in the Copyright Act.

The author of a computer program is the person who exercised control
over the making of the computer program[^south_africa_11]. Copyright in software
vests in the person regarded as the author[^south_africa_12] except when it vests in
the employer of the author because it is regarded as taking place in the
course of employment. Co-creators are joint-authors and usually
joint-owners. A computer program made *in the course of the author’s
employment* vests in the employer[^south_africa_13]. This has been interpreted very
broadly. A person who was not employed to write code who nevertheless
wrote code using his own time and computer resources but who used the
code in his work duties, and modified it to be compatible with software
used by his employer and as requested by fellow employees was held by a
court to have acted in the course of his employment[^south_africa_14]. The default
rule on employee created software may be modified by contract[^south_africa_15]. The
statutory provision that copyright in a computer program made by an
employee vests in the employer does not apply to contractors. However
the definition of author as the person who exercise control over the
making of a program has been interpreted so that an independent
contractor who planned and wrote code was not regarded as the author,
instead the person who contracted him and decided how he wanted the
software modified was regarded as the author[^south_africa_16]. One consequence is
that an independent contractor might be the author and owner of the
preparatory materials of a computer program and of literary, artistic,
musical and cinematographic outputs of a computer program while the
person who commissioned the contractor might be regarded as author and
owner of the computer program.

However when an independent contractor agrees to create a computer
program which is clearly specified beforehand and without further
instructions albeit periodic review then the independent contractor will
likely be the author[^south_africa_17]. There is no statutory provision to enable
variation by agreement of the default rule that apart from employment
relationships the person deemed to be author is owner, however an
agreement to assign copyright in a computer program that hasn’t yet been
written is valid[^south_africa_18].

Copyright in computer programs made under the direction or control of
the State or an international organization vests in the State or
international organization[^south_africa_19]. Copyright in software that is produced
under the direction or control of South African government departments
vests in a state held company; the State Information Technology Agency
(Pty) Ltd.[^south_africa_20]. If a literary, musical, artistic work or a computer
program is computer generated then the person who made the arrangements
for the creation of the work is regarded as the author [^south_africa_21]. The
category of computer generated computer program is confined to machine
generated code and doesn’t include use of software tools such as editors
or compilers.

### Exclusive Rights

According to section 11B of the Copyright Act the owner of copyright in
a computer program has the exclusive rights (following the sub-paragraph
designation in the Act) of: -

“(a) reproducing the computer program in any manner or form; (b)
publishing the computer program if it was hitherto unpublished[^south_africa_22] (c)
performing the computer program in public; (d) broadcasting the computer
program; (e) causing the computer program to be transmitted in a
diffusion service, unless such service transmits a lawful broadcast,
including the computer program, and is operated by the original
broadcaster; (f) making an adaptation of the computer program; (g)
doing, in relation to an adaptation of the computer program, any of the
acts specified in relation to the computer program in paragraphs (a) to
(e) inclusive; (h) letting, or offering or exposing for hire by way of
trade, directly or indirectly, a copy of the computer program.”

Reproduction in any manner or form includes digital forms. Reproducing a
substantial portion of a computer program is regarded as reproduction
and the same approach is taken to all the exclusive rights[^south_africa_23]. An
adaptation of a computer program is defined to include a version of the
program in a different programming language, code or notation different
or fixed in a different medium[^south_africa_24]. Compiling or decompiling a program
is regarded as making an adaptation. An adaptation must itself be a
computer program, that is subject code or object code. An adaptation is
always regarded as also a reproduction.[^south_africa_25]There is considerable
overlap between the definitions of reproduction and adaptation. Thus if
a user copies a computer program without significant modification he
will be regarded as having reproduced the program while if he modifies
it but retains a substantial portion then he will be regarded as having
both reproduced and adapted the program. Someone who creates an
adaptation may, absent use under an exception, require two licenses from
the rightsholder in the prior program, a license to reproduce and a
license to adapt. If the prior program has not been published then the
person creating the adaptation will also require a publication license
in order to distribute the program. An adaptation that is sufficiently
original will constitute an original computer program , even if it
infringes the first computer program [^south_africa_26].

The output generated by a computer program that is discernible by the
public is not a computer program but rather a literary, artistic work,
cinematographic film or sound recording. Performance is defined by
reference to ‘any mode of visual or acoustic presentation’[^south_africa_27]. It is
therefore not clear what amounts to performing a computer program in
public, especially if there is no output.

There is no specific right of distribution[^south_africa_28].

### Exceptions to Exclusive Rights

Lawful possessors of computer programs can use the single exception
specific to computer programs to make copies reasonably necessary for
back up, exclusively for personal or private purposes. The copies must
be destroyed when possession of the computer program ceases to be
lawful[^south_africa_29].

The Copyright Act lists a number of exceptions for literary and artistic
works. For each other category of work, including computer programs a
different selection from the list is applied, in so far as they can be
applied. For computer programs these include

-   fair dealing for purposes of criticism or review,

-   fair dealing in a broadcast or cinematographic film,

-   use in judicial proceedings,

-   quotation compatible with fair practice,

-   illustration for teaching compatible with fair practice,

-   reproduction in preparation for broadcast,

-   use in a broadcast where use in a cinematographic film has been
    authorized[^south_africa_30].

Precisely how many of these exceptions apply in practise to computer
programs is unclear. The validity of provisions purporting to restrict
use of the exceptions has not been ruled on but they are likely to be
ruled invalid as ‘contra boni mores’ and defeating the purpose of
copyright legislation.

### Moral Rights

Moral rights were introduced into South African copyright law in order
to comply with the Berne Convention, and there is no history nor legal
theory animating the rights. Computer programs are listed as one of the
type of works in which moral rights vest. The author of a computer
program has the moral rights, regardless of transfer of the copyright in
the program, to claim authorship of the computer program, and to object
to any distortion, mutilation or other modification prejudicial to his
honour or reputation but may not prevent changes absolutely necessary on
technical grounds or for the purpose of commercial exploitation[^south_africa_31].
Even though the inclusion of clauses purporting to transfer or waiver
moral rights in copyright agreements is common practice there is no
provision enabling the assignment or waiver of moral rights in the
authorising legislation.

### Term of Protection

The same term applies to computer programs, cinematographic films and
photographs; fifty years. The fifty years is calculated from the end of
the year in which the computer program is first published or made
available to the public, or if neither has taken place then fifty years
from the making of the program.

### Copyright Assignment

Copyright may be transferred by assignment or in a will [^south_africa_32]. An
assignment or an exclusive license must be in writing and signed[^south_africa_33].
The writing requirement can be met by a digital format[^south_africa_34]. The
signature requirement can only be met by an ‘advanced digital signature’
facilitated by a registered provider[^south_africa_35]. Any of the exclusive rights
can be assigned or licensed separately, and assignment can be limited to
a specific geographic area or to part of the copyright term.

Non exclusive licenses do not require any formalities and may be oral or
inferred from conduct but can be revoked at any time unless the non
exclusive license is granted by means of a contract which governs
revocation. It is not necessary for a license to use the term
irrevocable for it to be construed as irrevocable, however for a license
to be irrevocable it must be a contract, and whether it is irrevocable
will be depend on how the contract as a whole is construed. A contract
may specify in what circumstances, if any, a license may be
revoked[^south_africa_36]. A contractual license may specify that it is irrevocable
except for breach, and allow for automatic termination on breach,
termination on notice and reinstatement. Generally a contract is created
in South African law when two or more persons with the power to contract
engage in conduct that demonstrates an intention to be legally bound.
Although usually analyzed as an ‘offer’ and an ‘acceptance’ all that is
required is an objective ‘consensus ad idem’; that is a meeting of the
minds apparent from conduct of the parties. Consideration is not
required to form a binding contract in the South African common law of
contract.

### Technical Protection Measures and Anti-Circumvention

There are no provisions defining technical protection measures or
prohibiting circumvention of technical protection measures in South
African copyright law. However provisions of the Electronic
Communications and Transactions Act 2003 may operate as
anti-circumvention measures[^south_africa_37]. The Act creates a number of statutory
criminal offenses; intentionally accessing, or modifying, deleting or
de-activating data without authority or permission are criminal
offenses[^south_africa_38]. A copyright license constitutes permission to access or
modify data, while accessing or modifying data that falls within a
copyright exception would be authorized. The definition of the offenses
is so vague that the provision may be unconstitutional. Production,
distribution and possession of a computer program designed primarily to
overcome security measures for the protection of data is also a criminal
offense.

### Enforcement

Copyright in a computer program is infringed by anyone who without
permission, and absent an exception, commits one of the acts reserved
for the copyright holder. Parallel import of copies of a program legally
available in other jurisdictions can also be infringing in certain
circumstances. Knowingly importing (other than for private and domestic
use), selling, letting, distributing for trade or acquiring a computer
program produced outside South Africa without the permission of the
rights holder in South Africa is also an infringement[^south_africa_39]. As a result
of the requirement of knowledge a rightsholder who had authorized
production and distribution of a computer program outside South Africa
would thus have to give notice to recipients in South Africa of the
copies of the program legitimately produced elsewhere in order to render
future dealing with the copies infringing.

In addition to civil infringement of copyright certain commercial
activities have been criminalized. It is a criminal offense knowingly
and without permission from the copyright owner to:

-   make for sale or hire;

-   sell or let for hire;

-   exhibit in public by way of trade;

-   import into the Republic other than for private or domestic use;

-   distribute for purposes of trade or to such an extent so as to
    prejudice the owner;

infringing copies of a computer program. The owner of copyright in South
Africa may require the customs authorities to treat imported copyright
goods as prohibited goods[^south_africa_40].

The Counterfeit Goods Act[^south_africa_41] definition of counterfeiting includes
manufacturing, producing or making whether in South Africa or elsewhere
copyright infringing copies that are substantially identical to
copyright protected goods without the permission of the exclusive rights
holder in South Africa. Dealing in counterfeit goods is a criminal
offense, and alleged counterfeit goods may be seized by the police or
customs authorities.

## Unprotected software and public domain software

Computer programs are treated as a distinct category of work, defined as
instructions that direct the operation of a computer. Computer programs
are treated in a very similar way to cinematographic films, sound
recordings, broadcasts and programme carrying signals in respect of
authorship, terms and exclusive rights. Cinematographic films, sound
recordings, broadcasts and programme carrying signals are technical
works in which only the precise embodiment is protected. Abstract
aspects of these works are not protected by these categories although
they may be protected as literary, artistic or musical works. This
suggests that computer programs are also technical works and that
abstract aspects such as the architecture and the *look and feel* of a
program fall outside the definition of a computer program.

There is no provision in the copyright legislation that enables an
exclusive rights holder to dedicate a computer program to the public
domain. This does not mean that it is not possible to do so. South
African common law permits both abandonment of property, and waiver of
rights. Waiver of rights must take place through an unequivocal act by
the holder of the rights showing that he knew his rights and intended to
give them up. A written deed dedicating a computer program to the public
domain would seem to meet these criteria. Although a signature on the
deed would not be a formal requirement it would strongly indicate that a
rights holder knew he was giving up rights.

## Analysis of FOSS under South African law

A user who made substantial changes to copyleft code would require a
license from the rightsholder of the first version of the code since
making the changes would be an adaptation and a copy of the first
version of the code. Although South African copyright law permits a bare
copyright license without requiring a contract, the only way to ensure
that a non-exclusive license is not revocable at will is through
incorporating the license in a contract that governs revocation[^south_africa_42].
The general rule is that a person accepting an offer to contract must
communicate acceptance to the person making the offer. However it is
very well established that when the offer to contract itself sets out a
means of acceptance which does not require communication with the person
making the offer then acting in the manner prescribed constitutes
acceptance[^south_africa_43]

FOSS licenses can therefore be construed as contracts; use of a computer
program as permitted by the FOSS license, and adherence to the
requirements of the license constitute acceptance sufficient to create a
binding agreement. Anyone who uses FOSS licensed software in a way which
requires copyright permission but does not adhere to the license has
thus failed to accept the offer constituted by the license, has no
permission and therefore, if an exception does not apply to the use,
infringes the copyright in the software. If a license contains a
copyleft clause then a user of the software would have to comply with
the copyleft clause, including sharing changes under the same or
equivalent license in order to properly accept the contract under which
he gained permission. Failure to comply with the copyleft clause would
vitiate the formation of a contract and thus render a non-compliant user
liable for copyright infringement. Alternatively if there were
sufficient initial compliance with the terms of the FOSS license to
evidence an intention to be bound by the license then the terms of the
license would govern a breach.

It is not necessary to construe adherence to the terms of a FOSS license
as constituting consideration.

### Copyrights

When two or more authors collaborate to produce a computer program in
which contributions of each author are not separable from the
contribution of others the result is regarded as jointly authored. If
the results are separable, for example modules of a program, then each
constitutes a computer program for legal purposes even if it cannot
function without the other modules. The issue is not whether parts can
function separately but whether the contribution of skill, effort and
judgement of an author can be distinguished from others. The unique
definition of author of a computer program in South African copyright
law may make issues of joint authorship in FOSS projects less
problematic than in other jurisdictions since the author is regarded as
the person who exercises control over the making of the program, as a
result only someone with commit authority in a FOSS project can be
regarded as an author. If a project is set up so that a few contributors
are each responsible for a module or modules then each module may be
regarded as a separate program authored by that contributor.
Contributers of only a few lines of code will not be regarded as
authors. Only those who have authority to decide what is included in a
version of a program, or portion of a program will be authors.

The definition of authorship does however pose problems for FOSS in two
situations. Computer programmers who customize FOSS which they have
created for use in their workplaces run a risk that a court may regard
their work as vesting in their employers. The risk can be reduced by
contributors who are employees using FOSS without modification in their
workplaces or alternatively by stipulating clearly in employment
agreements that code shall be open source. Independent contractors who
customize FOSS for clients also face a risk that the client will be
regarded as having exercised control over the making of the computer
program and will be regarded as the author. Independent contractors
wishing to avoid that outcome should carefully limit the control
exercised by the client and in any case require agreement that whatever
code is written shall be distributed under the chosen FOSS license
regardless of who owns it.

Later versions of a FOSS program and forked FOSS code are reproductions
for as long as they contain substantial portions of the originating
program. They are also adaptations of the originating program, but only
if they can be regarded as including a substantial portion of the
originating program.

#### Assignment of copyrights

Assignment of copyright in a FOSS contributor’s agreement, such as the
agreement used by the Free Software Foundation will require a paper copy
be made and mailed, not because electronic documents are invalid but
because only a paper and ink signature or an advanced electronic
signature provided by a provider registered in South Africa will meet
the signature requirement for a valid copyright assignment. Use of
advanced electronic signatures is not widespread. On the other hand a
contributor to a FOSS project can agree to a contributor agreement which
grants non exclusive rights or licenses work directly under a FOSS
license online where the contributor agreement or license is recorded
digitally.

### Moral Rights

A contributor to a FOSS project has moral rights to the computer program
he has created. The right to object to modification does not extend to
changes that are absolutely necessary for functioning. Beyond that the
precise ambit of the moral rights as they apply to computer programs and
whether they can be waived is not clear. However the nature of the work
being created will influence what constitutes appropriate
acknowledgement of the right of authorship and what constitutes a
modification contrary to the author’s honour. FOSS is by its nature a
co-operative co-creation in which contributors agree concerning
acknowledgement and what changes others may make through either
contributor agreements or licences before committing code. It is
therefore unlikely that a South African court would find copying and
adaptations compliant with those commitments to infringe moral rights.

### Enforcing FOSS Licences

#### Parties to License

The license must be issued by the owner or a licensee authorised to
issue a FOSS license. In FOSS projects the owner is usually the author
or authors, that is those contributors with authority to decide what is
in a release version and their predecessors.

#### Contract

Rather than claiming breach of contract an author would simply claim
copyright infringement, the alleged infringer would have to demonstrate
compliance with the terms of the license in order to show acceptance of
the basis of permission. Alternatively if the user of the program
demonstrated sufficient initial compliance with the license so that the
creation of a contract must be inferred then the provisions of the
license as a contract apply. If the license, such as the GNU GPL
provides for automatic termination on breach then the license will be
terminated by breach and further use will be infringing. If a user has
demonstrated acceptance of the terms of a FOSS license which makes no
provision for revocation but the user subsequently does not comply with
the license the licensor may experience difficulties obtaining a court
order requiring compliance with the other terms of the contract because
South African courts prefer to award damages for breach of contract,
rather than enforce performance of agreements.

#### Violation of License Terms

Generally failure to adhere to the conditions of the license indicates a
refusal of the license construed as a contractual offer and thus no
contract is formed, a copier is then liable for copyright infringement.

### Waiver and Liability

There is no requirement arising from copyright legislation or common law
that a person providing FOSS provide any warranty in respect of the
software nor does any warranty arise automatically under copyright
legislation or common law. Disclaimers and limitations of liability are
valid under general principles of contract. However disclaimers and
limitations of liability in favour of third parties cannot take effect
unless one of the parties to the agreement accepts the benefit of the
limitation on behalf of the third party. This usually takes place
through a *stipulatio alteri* a provision in an agreement that a
specified third party will enjoy a specified benefit, and that one of
the parties will accept the benefit of behalf of the third party. For
example a software vendor which holds a sub-license to software may
include in an agreement with a customer a disclaimer of liability on
part of the software creator which is not party to the agreement; the
vendor would accept the benefit of the disclaimer on behalf of the
software creator. A limitation of liability which can be construed as a
unilateral waiver will not require acceptance of the benefit on behalf
of the third party.

FOSS licenses do not fall under consumer protection legislation. However
a transaction in which a service provider delivered goods and services
to a natural person that included FOSS for consideration in the course
of business would be subject to consumer protection legislation.

## Cases

There have been no reported cases as yet (June 2014).

### Legal Procedures

Only an owner or exclusive licensor can enforce the exclusive rights of
copyright[^south_africa_44]. An owner can claim an interdict [^south_africa_45], damages, or
reasonable royalties and delivery up of infringing copies[^south_africa_46]. If a
work was joint-authored all the joint-authors must agree to an
enforcement action for reasonable royalties or damages[^south_africa_47] because no
rights holder is entitled to all of the damages. A joint-author may
therefore apply for an interdict without the consent of the other
joint-authors. Joint-authors can enter into an agreement that specifies
what percentage of the profits from the computer program each is
entitled to which would enable a joint-author to begin legal proceedings
for his share of damages without the agreement of joint authors. A
defendant could himself join the other joint-authors to the proceedings.

A rights holder who has grounds to suspect copyright infringement and
that the suspected infringer is likely to dispose of the evidence of the
infringement may apply to court, without the alleged infringer being
given an opportunity to oppose the application, for an order authorizing
the seizure and safe keeping of the evidence pending its production in
litigation[^south_africa_48]. Damages will not be awarded against someone who proves
that there were no reasonable grounds for suspecting that copyright
subsisted in a computer program[^south_africa_49].

Whether a substantial portion of a computer program has been copied is a
qualitative question, a few dozen lines of code out of thousands may
constitute a substantial portion if they solve a particularly difficult
problem or are crucial in some other way to the functioning of the
program[^south_africa_50].
