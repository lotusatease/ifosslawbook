## Introduction to software protection under German law

### Body of law

In Germany, the Copyright Act[^germany_1] is the primary legislative regime
providing legal protection to software. Its key provisions relevant for
software are sections 69a through 69g. They were included in order to
implement the so-called EU Software Directive[^germany_2] into German national
law, and their language is almost identical with that of the EU
directive. However, insofar as there are no contradictions or unless the
act provides otherwise, the general rules of the Copyright Act (i.e., on
the transfer of rights, the legal consequences of infringements, etc.)
apply to software as well.[^germany_3]

### Object of protection

Following the understanding of the Berne Convention for the Protection
of Literary and Artistic Works and the framework of the Software
Directive, computer programs (including the preparatory material) are
literary works. According to UrhG, sec. 69a para 3, only original
computer programs are protected under copyright law.[^germany_4] This means that
the computer program needs to be the author’s “own intellectual
creation”. Sec. 69a para 2 sentence 2 of the Copyright Act explicitly
states that the ideas and principles underlying any element of a
computer program, including those which underlie its interfaces, do not
enjoy copyright protection.

But what does “the author’s own intellectual creation” mean? First, the
term “intellectual” refers to the condition that the computer program
must have been created by a human being and not a machine. Thus,
programs that are entirely computer-generated are not protected under
copyright law.[^germany_5] The only other prerequisite is that the creation must
be the author’s “own”. According to German case law and literature, this
confirms that the threshold for awarding copyright protection to
computer programs is low.[^germany_6] Hence, the creation does not need to be
exceptionally original, it is sufficient if the program has certain
specific characteristics that are not trivial or entirely banal.[^germany_7] The
Federal Court of Justice held in a decision from 2005 that there is even
a presumption for sufficient individuality if a computer program is
complex.[^germany_8] This ruling has consequences in cases where the
copyrightability of a program is disputed. The creator of the program
has only to show that this program is complex, whereupon the opponent
has the full burden to show and prove that the program is in fact not
individual enough.

### Authors/Beneficiaries

Generally, all rights in a work belong to the actual author. Sec. 69b of
the Copyright Act, a special provision on the ownership of the rights on
computer programs, does not defer from this principle, but stipulates
that where a computer program is created by an employee in the execution
of her duties or following her employer’s instructions, the employer
shall be exclusively entitled to exercise all economic rights in the
program created, unless otherwise provided for by contract. Other than
under the work made for hire doctrine, which is well-established in the
USA, for instance sec. 69b does not provide for a fiction of authorship
to the benefit of a developer’s employer, but maintains the principle
that only the actual creator of a work can be considered its author.
However, sec. 69b achieves the goal of easing the exploitation of
computer programs made by larger developer groups hired by software
companies by a statutory grant of all necessary economic rights in the
software. The original authors are thus confined to assert their moral
rights in very special situations.[^germany_9]

For an analysis of joint authorship, derivative works, compound works,
and collective works see below.[^germany_10]

### Exclusive rights

The right holder’s exclusive rights are set out in UrhG, sec. 69c, which
implements the specifications of sec. 4 of the Software Directive: the
author of a computer program has the exclusive right to reproduce the
computer program by any means and in any form; to translate, adapt,
arrange or otherwise alter the program; to distribute the program
including to rent and lend the program; and to communicate it to the
public. Distribution means any act by which a *physical copy* of the
work is put into circulation or any offer to the public to distribute
such a copy. It includes the right to rent physical copies of the work.
In contrast to the distribution right, the right to communicate a work
to the public covers only acts by which the owner does not transfer
physical copies of the work. From a practical point of view, among the
several rights that are sub-categories of the right to communicate a
program to the public (such as the right of recitation, performance and
presentation, broadcasting, communication by means of video or audio
recordings, etc.), only the making available to the public right is
relevant. It covers acts where a work is made available to the public in
such a way that members of the public may access it from a place and at
a time individually chosen by them, e.g., offering a work for download
and software-as-a-service.

### Exceptions to exclusive rights

Sec. 69c no. 3 sentence 2 of the Copyright Act sets forth the principle
of exhaustion. According to this provision, the distribution right is
exhausted whenever a copy of a computer program is put into circulation
by way of sale[^germany_11] within the territory of the European Communities or
in another Contracting State of the Convention Concerning the European
Economic Area[^germany_12] with the consent of the right holder, with the
exception of the rental right. Whether this applies only to the physical
distribution of software (that is, on data storage media) or whether the
principle of exhaustion also applies to online transmissions was highly
disputed in German legal circles until recently. The problem was that
the language of sec. 69c no. 3 sentence 2 seems to require that the
rights holders themselves put a copy of the program into (physical)
distribution, whereas in cases where the program is made available for
download, it is the downloading recipient of the software, rather than
the right holder who creates the physical copy. Hence, interpreting the
above provision narrowly would mean that it could not be applied to
making-available situations, as the right holder would not “put a copy
of the program into circulation”.[^germany_13] However, as it appears odd to
disadvantage the more efficient, faster, and commonly used distribution
channel of downloading, a number of scholars and courts have opined that
exhaustion is also possible where a copy of a program was made by its
downloading recipient.[^germany_14] According to this approach, the recipient
would be entitled to give away this copy to anyone else, provided that
she deletes from her systems all copies of the program she has made. On
3 July 2012, the Court of Justice of the European Union has, in its
*UsedSoft* decision, recognized the so-called "online exhaustion".[^germany_15]
Applying the principles established in that decision, the German Federal
Court of Justice held in 2013 that the owner of a copy of a computer
program downloaded by her may give that program to a third party if the
following conditions are met: (1) the original owner paid a fee to the
copyright holder for receiving her program copy; (2) the original
owner’s license was not limited in time; and (3) the original owner’s
program copy must be made unusable. Moreover, any improvements and
updates the copy the new owner receives may contain must be covered by a
maintenance agreement between the copyright holder and the original
owner of the copy of the computer program.[^germany_16]

Equally contentious, and in its details certainly not easy to
understand, are the exceptions provided for in UrhG, sec. 69d and 69e.
Their origin is, not surprisingly, the Software Directive. The
exceptions are intended to balance the interests of protection for
software developing companies on the one hand, and the interests of
users in maintaining the usability of their copies of the program and in
developing new compatible programs on the other.

According to UrhG, sec. 69d para 1, users of a computer program do not
need to obtain a license for the reproduction and alteration of the
software if these acts are necessary for the use of the program in
accordance with its intended purpose and the user is entitled to use a
copy of the program.[^germany_17] The provision specifically points out that
error corrections can be allowed without the need to receive a license.
Confusingly, the paragraph also contains language stating that the
exercise of these rights is subject to the condition of no specific
contractual provisions stipulating otherwise. Does this mean that sec.
69d para 1 can be fully waived? The prevailing opinion in Germany
answers this question in the negative, saying that sec. 69d para 1
contains a core of exceptions that may not be forgone.[^germany_18] The German
Federal Court of Justice confirmed this opinion in *UsedSoft II*.

In addition, the requirement of an “intended purpose” poses manifold
problems that are beyond the scope of this chapter. UrhG, sec. 69d para
2 allows lawful users of a copy of a computer program to make a back-up
copy insofar as it is necessary to ensure future use, even if
contractual obligations of the owner of the copy with the right holder
provide otherwise.

Sec.69d para 3 of the Copyright Act contains an interesting rule, giving
lawful users of a copy of a computer program the right to observe,
study, or test the functioning of the program “in order to determine the
ideas and principles which underlie any element of the program if she
does so while performing any of the acts of loading, displaying,
running, transmitting or storing the program which she is entitled to
do.” UrhG, sec. 69d para 2 and 3 may not be overridden by contract, as
UrhG, sec. 69g para 2 unequivocally states.

The same is true for the rule set out by UrhG, sec. 69e. According to
this provision, authorization of the right holder is not necessary when
the reproduction of a program and its translation into another form,
including the decompilation, is indispensable to obtain the information
necessary to achieve the interoperability of an independently created
computer program with other programs, if certain conditions are
met.[^germany_19]

### Moral rights

German copyright traditionally recognizes strong moral rights of the
authors of protected works. In principle, this is also true for
copyrighted software. Moral rights are not within the scope of the EU
Software Directive: thus, the general rules of German copyright law on
moral rights apply that is, in particular, UrhG, sec. 12 through
14.[^germany_20] However, there is much discussion about the extent to which
authors of computer programs enjoy moral rights. It appears that the
tendency is to award them less protection than to authors of “classical”
works protected by copyright law.[^germany_21]

Sec. 12 gives authors the right to decide whether and how their works
are to be published. Its practical importance for software is
negligible.

Sec. 13 grants authors the right of recognition of their authorship
(sentence 1), and the right to decide whether the work is to bear an
author’s designation and what kind of designation that should be
(sentence 2). The prevailing view is that an author may not completely
waive his right of recognition[^germany_22], even in an employer-employee
relationship.[^germany_23] On the other hand, authors may renounce their right
to be expressly named on each copy of the software.[^germany_24] This can be
done impliedly for instance, if the author was aware of a business
practice that does not list the actual developers.[^germany_25]

Sec. 14 provides for the right to prohibit any distortion of an author’s
work which would jeopardize her legitimate intellectual or personal
interest in the work. Examples could include the use of a work in a
certain way that could negatively reflect on the author’s reputation,
such as the use of the work in a racist or pornographic context, or the
distribution of versions of the work in particularly bad quality.

In addition, the recognition of moral rights has a strong impact on the
possibilities to assign or grant rights in copyrighted works. For
details, see the “Copyright assignment” section below.

### Term of protection

For computer programs, the same provisions on the protection term apply
as for works of literature and art: the copyright expires 70 years as of
January 1 following the death of the author (UrhG, sec. 64, 69). If a
work was created by joint authors, the 70-year period is calculated from
the date of the death of the last surviving author (UrhG, sec. 65 para
1). As to derivative works, there is no special rule as both the author
of the original work and the author of the derivative work hold
independent copyrights. Thus, each protection term is calculated
separately under the general rule. For anonymous and pseudonymous works,
the deciding date is the publication of the work (UrhG, sec. 66 para 1).
If, however, the author or his legal successor reveals her identity
before the expiration — that is within the 70-year period after
publication — or if the author’s identity is clear, the duration of the
copyright is calculated under the general rule set forth in sec. 64 and
65 (UrhG, sec. 66 para 2).

### Copyright assignment

In principle, German copyright law does not distinguish between software
and other protected works when it comes to the fundamental mechanisms of
the transfer and assignment of rights. German copyright tradition is
built on the idea that both economic and moral interests in a work come
from the same root (so called “monism theory”). As moral interests are
seen as being linked directly with an author’s personality, it is not
possible for an author to completely assign all rights in a work or, to
put it in other words, to entirely transfer the ownership of the work.
This being said, it cannot come as a surprise that the concept of works
made for hire is foreign to German copyright law as well.

The legal mechanism used for giving other parties the rights to use and
exploit a work is the grant of a bundle of rights. To achieve results
similar to a complete copyright transfer, one would grant all exclusive
usage rights to the licensee. The original author would still be
entitled to her moral rights and could object to certain uses on their
basis.[^germany_26]

However, art. 2 para 3 of the Software Directive caused the German
legislator to introduce a clause into the Copyright Act that
significantly eases the acquisition of developers' rights by their
employers. Sec. 69b, which is applicable only to software but not to
other work categories, implements this EU provision and provides that
“\[w\]here a computer program is created by an employee in the execution
of his duties or following the instructions given by his employer, the
employer exclusively shall be entitled to exercise all the economic
rights in the program, unless otherwise agreed.” Thus, it is presumed
that an employer obtains all economic rights in a software program
created by an employee as long as the creation of the program occurred
within the framework of her obligations as an employee. Two
observations: First, the employer does not become the author of the
software (as would be the case if it were a work made for hire system)
but only obtains the economic rights that is, the rights needed for the
commercial exploitation of the work. The moral rights, however, remain
unaffected. Second, the presumption can be overcome by individual
agreement.

### Special measures

In case of infringement, a mix of provisions governing the enforcement
of the copyright applies. Most general provisions of the Copyright Act
are applicable to software in the same way as to any other
copyright-protected work. Most importantly, sec. 97 para 1 accords to
the authors and holders of exclusive rights the right to demand from the
infringer to cease and desist from her infringing actions (provided that
there is the danger that she will repeat the infringement,
*Unterlassungsanspruch*) and to correct the infringement already caused
(*Beseitigungsanspruch*). Moreover, where the infringement was
intentional or the result of negligence, the holders of exclusive rights
may also ask for damages (sec. 97 para 2).[^germany_27] According to sec. 97
para 2 sentence 4, authors may also demand a monetary indemnity for the
injury caused to them even if no pecuniary loss has occurred. Sec. 101
accords to the infringed right holders the right to require from the
infringer to be informed as to the origin and distribution channels of
the infringing copies, which includes in particular the name and address
of the manufacturer; the supplier and other prior owners of the copies
and of the commercial customers; the quantity of copies that have been
manufactured, dispatched, received or ordered; and the prices obtained.

In addition, UrhG, sec. 69f contains special provisions exclusively
governing software, in particular with regard to DRM protection, and
pursuant to UrhG, sec. 69a para 5, the general provisions about DRM
protection (UrhG, sec. 95a through 95d) do not apply to software.

According to UrhG, sec. 69f para 1, the holder of the rights in a
computer program is entitled to demand from anyone who owns or possesses
unlawfully manufactured or distributed copies, or copies intended for
unlawful distribution, to destroy these copies. This right does not
require intent or negligence on the part of the owner or proprietor, nor
is it required that the owner or proprietor herself infringed on the
copyright. It is sufficient that the copies are made or distributed in
an objectively unlawful way. In this sense, sec. 69f para 1 is
considerably further-reaching than the general rule set forth in sec. 98
para 1 of the Copyright Act, according to which the right to require the
destruction of unlawful copies can only be enforced against the actual
infringers.[^germany_28] Apart from that, the right owner may also require ---
for appropriate compensation — that the owner or proprietor hand over
the infringing copies to her (sec. 69f para 1 sentence 2).

Sec. 69f para 1 applies *mutatis mutandis* to any means whose sole
intended purpose is to facilitate the unauthorized removal or
circumvention of any technical mechanism that protects the software from
copyright-infringing acts (sec. 69f para 2). In comparison with the
general provisions on technological measures that are designed to
restrict or prevent certain acts which are not authorized by the right
holder and on destruction claims, there are a number of important
differences. First, sec. 69f para 2 does not provide for a direct
prohibition of any act of circumventing technical measures. Second, sec.
69f para 2 applies only when the circumvention means are *solely*
designed for circumvention purposes, whereas sec. 98 para 1 sentence 2
of the Copyright Act provides for a destruction claim also in cases
where a means is *predominantly* used for the creation of infringing
copies. Third, sec. 69f para 2 (as para 1) does not require intent or
negligence. Finally, para 2, just as para 1, provides for a claim
against any owner or proprietor irrespective of whether she is the
infringer.

### The right to equitable remuneration and the so-called “Linux clause”

With a right to equitable remuneration of each author, in 2002 the
German legislator introduced a feature into copyright law that is rather
uncommon on the international level. According to UrhG, sec. 32 para 1
sentence 3, if the initially agreed compensation is not equitable, any
author has the right to require assent from the other contracting party
to amend the license agreement concluded between the two parties so that
the author is assured equitable remuneration. As this obviously has the
potential to conflict with the concept of FOSS, the German legislator,
pressed by the FOSS community, researchers, and practitioners,[^germany_29]
inserted into UrhG, sec. 32 para 3 sentence 3 an exception to this rule
called the *Linux clause*. According to this provision, the author may
“grant a non-exclusive exploitation right without consideration to the
world at large,”[^germany_30], which excludes the right to claim equitable
remuneration at any later point.

The situation is similar with regard to UrhG, sec. 32a, another
provision protecting authors' interests in getting a fair share of the
returns gained by using their works. This provision provides for an
author’s right to demand further compensation for the exploitation of
her work, in situations where the conditions of the grant of rights
cause the agreed consideration to be conspicuously disproportionate to
the returns and advantages from the use of the work. According to sec.
32a para 2, even third parties can be liable to pay to the author
additional compensation, if the author’s licensee has transferred the
exploitation rights granted to her, or granted further exploitation
rights, and the conspicuous disproportion results from advantages to
this third party. In this case, the original licensee ceases to be
liable under sec. 32a. In order to protect the functioning of the FOSS
concept that is built on not paying for the exploitation rights, the
German legislator decided to include in sec. 32a para 3 sentence 3 the
same exception as sec. 32 para 3 sentence 3 delineated above.[^germany_31]

According to their wording, both sec. 32 para 3 sentence 3 and 32a para
3 sentence 3 only apply if the author herself puts her work under a
general non-exclusive license for everyone. Yet one might wonder whether
she can claim equitable remuneration or additional compensation if she
grants exclusive rights to a third party who later puts the work under a
FOSS license. There is no case law on this matter; but if the license
agreement between the author and the third party expressly provides for
the third party’s right to distribute the program as FOSS, the situation
is so similar to the one directly contemplated by said provisions of the
Copyright Act that in this case they should be applied by way of
analogy. However, the outcome should be different if the author’s
licensee uses both a FOSS and a commercial license. In such a case, the
author must get a fair share of the returns made by the commercial
distribution of her creation; the Linux clauses do not apply.

Another issue should also be briefly considered. It deals with whether
or not UrhG, sec. 32 and 32a have a bearing on cases where software was
created in an employer-employee relationship (which is, as discussed
above, governed by the presumption of UrhG, sec. 69b).[^germany_32] There is no
authoritative answer to this question so far; however, based on older
case law regarding sec. 32a’s predecessor[^germany_33] it seems likely that sec.
32a also applies if an employer obtained exploitation rights under sec.
69b.[^germany_34] The consequence is that an employee who did not give her
consent to the distribution of his creation under a FOSS license would
not be hindered in raising a claim under sec. 32a UrhG. If, on the other
hand, the employee assented to a FOSS distribution, sec. 32a para 3
sentence 3 should apply by way of analogy. In contrast, sec. 32 is
probably not applicable to employed software authors.[^germany_35]

## Unprotected software and public domain software

As explained, German copyright doctrine does not allow the complete
waiver of one’s copyright, and consequently, public domain software
cannot be seen as software to which the author has forgone all her
copyrights. Hence, real public domain software — software without a
rights holder — is a phenomenon that can occur only after the expiration
of the protection term. However, the term “public domain software” is
widely used in Germany as it is in other countries. As this may not be
understood as the non-existence of any rights in the software, another
mechanism applies for giving effect to a right holder’s desire to enable
everyone to freely use the program: putting a program in the public
domain can be interpreted as granting to everyone a non-exclusive right
to use the software.[^germany_36]

However, FOSS is not considered public domain software, as FOSS authors
do not give up their rights but rather use copyright to enforce their
interests.[^germany_37]

## Analysis of FOSS under German law

### Copyrights

#### Qualification of FOSS

Even though the general public often assumes that a FOSS author forgoes
her rights, the generally accepted opinion among lawyers, including the
courts, is correctly that FOSS authors rather use the traditional
mechanisms of copyright to enforce their particular interests.[^germany_38]
Thus, the analysis of FOSS under German copyright law can build on its
generally accepted structures.

The first issue that has to be dealt with is the question of authorship:
Who is the original rights-owner of FOSS software? And who is entitled
to enforce the rights emanating from authorship? The general principles
of authorship have been presented above, but how do they apply to
software that from the outset is often created by a group of developers
and then set free so that hundreds or thousands of people contribute to
the further development of the software?

Four terms representing different concepts come to mind: co- or joint
authorship, derivative works, compound works, and collective works.

### Rights of the original co-authors

Sec. 8 para 1 of the Copyright Act sets out two factors of joint
authorship: (1) the work must have been jointly created by several
authors; and (2) their contributions cannot be separately exploited.

(1) Joint creation:

Joint authorship requires that two or more authors willfully collaborate
in order to create a work. They must follow a common idea and have a
shared plan to create a unitary work. Joint authors agree on a common
task and reciprocally align the creative process with the collective
idea to create an integrated work.[^germany_39] In contrast, the creator of a
derivative work does not collaborate with the author of the original
work.

It is not necessary, however, for the authors to work at the same time
or at the same place.[^germany_40] Hence, collaborative software development
over networks can lead to the creation of a joint work, as would
developing a program while being in the same office. Nevertheless, in
most FOSS projects joint authorship is less common than the creation of
derivative works.

(2) Unitary exploitation:

Joint authorship further requires that the contributions of the distinct
authors cannot be exploited separately. If a separate exploitation is
possible — as is the case, for instance, for software modules or
libraries — it is rather a case of compound works (UrhG, sec. 9).

According to para 2 of sec. 8 of the Copyright Act, “the right of
publication and of exploitation of the work shall belong jointly to the
joint authors.” Alterations to the work are permissible only if every
joint author consents. The consequence of this is that every contributor
to a jointly developed computer program has to agree with the
exploitation of the program, in particular with putting it under a FOSS
license.[^germany_41]

The third sentence of para 2 of the provision is of great importance for
the enforcement of FOSS licenses. Pursuant to its terms, each joint
author alone is entitled to assert claims arising from infringements of
the joint copyright. Hence, it enables every contributor to enforce
compliance with the applicable FOSS license through cease and desist
claims under UrhG, sec. 97 para 1. However, it should be noted that a
single joint author may demand payment of damages only to all joint
authors. This means that while one single joint author is in principle
allowed to enforce payment claims, she must, when doing so, name every
other co-author of the work and demand payment to all co-authors
together. The purpose of this requirement is the protection of the other
co-authors not raising the payment claim. The treatment of information
claims is disputed, but it seems reasonable to allow each single author
to enforce this kind of claim alone without being obligated to refer to
each and every co-author.[^germany_42]

### Authors of derivative works

Another way of creating new software is the alteration of pre-existing
programs, as contemplated by UrhG, sec. 3, 23, and 69c No. 2. If this is
the case, both the old and the new work are separately protected under
copyright law. However, the author of the derived work needs consent
from the author of the original work in order to be able to lawfully
exploit the new creation. It is not always easy to decide whether a work
was created as a joint work or just derived from another one. The main
aspect is the afore-mentioned factor of having a common, shared plan: if
one existed and the contributions were not separately exploitable, it is
a case of joint authorship; otherwise, it is a derivative work or a case
of compound works.

In derivative work situations, both the author of the original work and
the author of the derived work may enforce their own rights without
having to involve the other.

### Compound works

Independent works — that is, works that were created and can be
exploited independently from each other — that are combined by several
authors for exploitation in common are called compound works and are
governed by UrhG, sec. 9. Sec. 9 not only requires the act of combining
the works, but the combination must be made for *joint exploitation*. In
other words, the respective authors must enter — expressly or
impliedly — into an agreement that the works are supposed to be
exploited in common.[^germany_43] Hence, compound works may be created only if
each author consents in advance to the combination of the works. The
legal consequence is that each author of the several works combined may
require from the others their consent to the publication, exploitation,
or alteration of the compound works, provided that such consent may be
reasonably demanded of them. Contrary to cases of joint authorship, the
authorship on every separate work remains unaffected by the combination.
Thus, the rights in each separate work can be enforced separately.

### Collective works

In addition, German copyright law also protects collective works. These
are collections of works, data, or other independent elements, provided
that the collection itself is a personal intellectual creation (UrhG,
sec. 4 para 1) — in other words, work as defined by UrhG, sec. 2 para 2.

The difference between collective works and works of joint authorship is
that in the latter case, one single work is created whose parts cannot
be exploited separately, whereas an exploitation of the parts of a
collective work is perfectly possible. If a work is co-authored, only
one work exists; if a collection is created, one can distinguish between
the collection as one work, and its parts as different works.

The decisive aspect for the distinction between collections and compound
works is the following: For bringing compounds of works into existence,
it is necessary that the authors of the individual works themselves
determine what works should be combined and decide that exactly these
works should be exploited in common. In the case of a collection, by
contrast, the authors of the several parts grant exploitation rights to
a third party and do not designate which works will eventually be used
for the collection.[^germany_44]

Due to the fact that the copyright in the collective work is independent
from that in the parts of the collection (provided they are works), the
exploitation of the collective work requires the consent of both the
creator of the collective work and the authors of its parts.[^germany_45] Each
author, including the author of the collection, may enforce her rights
separately.

### The assignment of copyrights

Copyright assignments or contribution agreements that are designed to
transfer the complete copyright to the assignee are problematic under
German law. Under German copyright law, the complete transfer of
copyright is not possible, so such assignments risk being void.
Therefore, when drafting such agreements, it is recommended to take into
consideration the legal situation in Germany and other “droit
d’auteur”-countries. The solution that comes closest to a complete
transfer is the grant of all exclusive usage rights to the licensee,
leaving the author her moral rights that enable her to object to certain
uses.

FOSS developers relatively often enter into so-called fiduciary license
agreements or contribution agreements, according to which the grantee
receives unlimited exclusive rights in the developer’s work. These kinds
of agreements are used for avoiding copyright fragmentation; they serve
to concentrate the rights, with one person or entity having the means to
take care of licensing and copyright enforcement. In order to protect
the FOSS principle, fiduciary license agreements often contain a clause
linking the allegiance of the fiduciary to FOSS principles with the
validity of the grant itself.[^germany_46] If, in contrast, the grantee has the
right to license the work against license fees, the grantor is entitled
to equitable remuneration (see UrhG, sec. 32), and the agreement should
provide for a compensation clause.[^germany_47]

### Moral rights

Even though moral rights play a rather minor role in the software
context, they may have some ramifications on the use of FOSS. Most
importantly, from a practical perspective, authors are entitled to
decide whether the work is to bear an author’s designation and what
designation is to be used (UrhG, sec. 13).

In addition, FOSS developers have a particular interest in maintaining a
flawless reputation. Thus, they have a strong interest in fighting
distortions of their works that may be detrimental to their standing,
which argues for the application of UrhG, sec. 14, at least in some
cases. However, it should be considered that software is by its nature
normally subject to further developments, and that in addition many FOSS
licenses require licensees to clearly indicate each modification made to
the software.[^germany_48] Nevertheless, this does not totally exclude the
possibility that authors rely in certain cases on UrhG, sec. 14.

But what if a license — such as the GNU General Public
License[^germany_49] — stipulates that the licensor allows any kind of
alteration to the software? The answer to this question lies in the
general tendency of German copyright law to always protect a core of
authors' moral interests. Thus a complete renouncement for the future,
especially in so-called standard business terms,[^germany_50] is not possible.
Consequently, in some more severe cases, developers will be able to
enforce their moral rights against modifications of their software even
if the applicable FOSS license seems to allow any kind of alterations,
the infringing one included.

### Enforcing FOSS licenses

#### Contractual relationships

Under German law, FOSS licenses are commonly seen as license agreements
between the licensor and the licensee, and therefore as contracts.[^germany_51]
When receiving FOSS, however, in most cases the FOSS license agreement
is not the only contractual relationship the receiving party enters
into: normally, the distributor of the software will not be identical
with the holder of the exclusive rights; hence, there will also be an
agreement between the recipient of the software and the distributor
handing her the software. In the following, we will focus on this case
where right holders and distributors are not identical. It is crucial
then to distinguish between these two basic relationships, as otherwise
it is impossible to come to correct assessments of issues like liability
and warranty. All issues relating to copyrights in the FOSS have to be
determined under the FOSS license agreement. This covers first of all
the question of what exploitation rights the user of the FOSS has, what
conditions she must meet, and what the consequences of a breach of the
license requirements are. Problems like the legal responsibility for the
software itself have to be solved under the agreement between the
supplier and the recipient of the software. The most important issue in
this context is the legal responsibility for defects in the software.
However, a lack of title can be a problem of the relationship between
the distributor and the user, as well.

Finally, it should be noted that although we are dealing here with a
triangle of relationships, so far only two sides of this triangle have
been mentioned. The missing part is the relationship between the holder
of the exclusive rights and the distributor. All problems concerning
rights, warranties, and liability are governed by their specific
agreements.

#### Validity of the contract

The mechanisms of the conclusion and validity of the contract between
the supplier and the recipient of the software do not pose any specific
problems. Therefore, the focus of the following analysis will be on the
relationship between the holder of the exclusive FOSS rights and its
licensee.

(1) Contract as offer and acceptance

Any contract is entered into by an offer from one party and the
corresponding acceptance by the other. The German understanding is that
the delivery of the license text of a FOSS license constitutes a valid
offer.[^germany_52] Any use of the software by the licensee requiring the grant
of a right to her that exceeds the limits of the statutory permissions
under UrhG, sec. 69d, can be construed as an implied acceptance.[^germany_53]
Normally, however, the offeror needs to be notified of the acceptance in
order for a contract to come into existence; but according to sec. 151
sentence 1 of the German Civil Code, [^germany_54] a notification of the offeror
is not required if such notification is not to be expected according to
customary practice, or if the offeror has waived it. In case of the use
of a FOSS license by the holder of the exclusive rights in a computer
program, it is fair to say that both alternatives may apply: the right
holder waives the notification requirement by relying on the FOSS
license, and it is customary practice in these kinds of cases not to
notify the right holder of the acceptance.[^germany_55]

(2) The law on standard business terms

The particularities of German private law pose another problem as to the
question of whether licensor and licensee validly agreed on the terms of
a FOSS license that was included in the software delivery: FOSS licenses
are not written for individual contracts but formulated for an
indefinite number of contracts and presented by the licensor to the
potential licensee with no chance for the latter to negotiate their
terms. Thus, they are generally regarded as standard business
terms,[^germany_56] which are governed by the restrictions of BGB, sec. 305
through 310. These provisions were introduced into the Civil Code with
the purpose of protecting parties to whom standard business terms are
presented. The first problem that arises from this fact is how a FOSS
license in its quality as standard business terms becomes a part of a
contract between both parties. How does the licensee take cognizance of
the license (or at least of the fact that the software at hand is under
a FOSS license)? And is it a problem that the license text is in
English, a foreign language for most people living in Germany?

Pursuant to BGB, sec. 305 para 2, standard business terms “only become a
part of a contract if the user, when entering into the contract, (1)
refers the other party to the contract to them explicitly or, where
explicit reference, due to the way in which the contract is entered
into, is possible only with disproportionate difficulty, by posting a
clearly visible notice at the place where the contract is entered into,
and (2) gives the other party to the contract, in an acceptable manner,
which also takes into reasonable account any physical handicap of the
other party to the contract that is discernible to the user, the
opportunity to take notice of their contents, and if the other party to
the contract agrees to their applying.”[^germany_57]

In most cases of FOSS distribution, these requirements will not be
fulfilled.[^germany_58] However, from a practical perspective, this is not a
real problem. First, irrespective of the license being incorporated into
a contractual relationship between the FOSS licensor and a licensee, the
limitation of warranties and liability normally contained in FOSS
licenses are in any case void.[^germany_59] Moreover, the mere use of a computer
program is allowed pursuant to UrhG, sec. 69d, without the necessity for
the parties to enter into a license agreement.[^germany_60] Hence, in most cases
of using a FOSS program, there is no need for a license agreement at
all. Only if someone desires to make further-reaching use of the
software than allowed by UrhG, sec. 69d would one need to obtain a
license. In such a case, it would be self-contradictory to assert on the
one hand rights that can only be granted through a license agreement,
and to claim on the other hand that this license is void (*venire contra
factum proprium*).

Therefore, one can presume that someone who distributes, modifies, or
reproduces FOSS has taken cognizance of the applicable license and has
accepted its terms.[^germany_61]

The same reasoning applies *mutatis mutandis* to the issue of the
license language: sserting on the one hand that the license is void
because of its language but relying at the same time on the rights
granted thereunder would be self-contradictory. In addition, the FOSS
license forms the entire contractual relationship between licensor and
licensee, including the language of the initial offer to enter into an
agreement. In such a case — the language of the negotiations between the
parties being not German — the incorporation of non-German standard
business terms is possible and valid.[^germany_62]

(3) Waiver of warranty and liability

As briefly mentioned before, the common warranty and liability waivers
contained in FOSS licenses go far beyond what is permitted in standard
business terms, whether in agreements with consumers or in pure business
matters.[^germany_63] Consequently they are considered void.

(4) Antitrust law

The compliance of FOSS copyleft licenses with competition law is another
issue worth mentioning. One could argue that such licenses are in
conflict with the prohibition of price fixing as they force licensees to
give away modified works for free - that is at a fixed price. However,
the prevailing view in Germany is — with differing reasons — that the
obligation to distribute derivative works for free cannot be regarded as
price-fixing.[^germany_64]

Moreover, users of FOSS could not gain very much from claiming that the
relevant license is void. They need a license in order to be able to
make use of the software, at least if the use exceeds the boundaries of
UrhG, sec. 69d. If a court declares the FOSS license void or not
applicable, they would still not obtain a license and would thus not be
entitled to the use of the desired software.[^germany_65] They can either
receive the required rights through the FOSS license, or they will have
no rights at all.

#### Violation of license conditions

Whether the violation of a license agreement is merely a breach of
contract or also constitutes a copyright infringement, is a standard
problem known from many intellectual property cases. Many FOSS licenses
address this issue by including an express provision on the effects of
violating the license terms. Sec. 4 of the GPLv2, for instance, states
clearly that any failure to comply with the conditions of the GPLv2 will
automatically terminate the license. German courts had no problem with
aligning this with the basic principles of German private and copyright
law. From the very first case, the courts followed the prevailing
academic opinion and interpreted this as a condition subsequent,
pursuant to BGB, sec. 158 para 2.[^germany_66] Consequently, it is generally
accepted that violations of FOSS licenses which include express
conditions on the grant of rights constitute copyright infringements and
not merely a breach of contract. It should be noted that an infringer
beginning to comply with the FOSS license conditions cannot “heal” the
past infringement; the “old” license is not reinstated in such a case,
but she enters into a new license agreement with the FOSS licensor.

### Waiver and liability

As mentioned above, the complete waiver of any warranty and liability
commonly used in FOSS licenses conflicts with general principles of
German private law and is void. But what is the impact of the
ineffectiveness of these provisions? The starting point for finding an
answer to this question is evident: the statutory law on warranties and
liability applies. But what exactly does this mean?

In order to carry out a correct analysis of this problem, one has to
clearly distinguish between the contractual relationships among the
parties involved.

#### Relationship distributor — user

As far as the relationship between distributor and user is concerned,
the ineffectiveness of the waivers has no importance, as they would
apply only to the relationship between the holder of the exclusive
rights in the software and her licensee. What is the distributor’s
liability then? The answer to this question depends on several factors.
In cases where the distributor and the user do not enter into a specific
agreement on warranties and liability, the most important question is
whether the distributor gives away the software completely for free or
whether payments for handing out the software are involved (for
instance, “for the physical act of transferring a copy,”[^germany_67] or if the
software is offered in a package with support services[^germany_68]). In the
first case, the provisions of the law on donations apply, thereby
considerably limiting the distributor’s liability. According to BGB,
sec. 524 para 1, the sole liability a donor bears is that she has to pay
damages to her contractual partner if she fraudulently concealed a
defect of quality.[^germany_69] Thus, the distributor must advise her customers
of bugs she knows about. Defects of title are dealt with in BGB, sec.
523 para 1, in exactly the same way. A distributor would be liable, for
example, for damages caused by her passing the software off as open
source software against her better knowledge.

The liability for damaging events that do not affect the equivalence of
the contractual primary obligations but impair the value of the donnee’s
property in general (that is, not the donated software itself) is
governed by BGB, sec. 521, according to which the donor’s liability is
restricted to acts of intent and gross negligence.

If, on the other hand, the distributor gives away the software while she
receives payments from her customers, the privileges for donors that
German private law provides for do not necessarily apply. It is
impossible to find a general rule precisely stipulating when, in cases
of contracts containing a mix of paid and unpaid duties, the whole
contract must be considered non-gratuitous. The general tendency appears
to rather assume that this kind of agreement is for remuneration. In
this case, much stricter rules on liabilities and warranties — the law
of the sale of goods — apply. Thus, according to BGB, sec. 439, the
recipient of the software may demand supplementary performance from the
distributor if the software received is defective as to its quality. If
she fails to remedy the defect within a reasonable time, the recipient
may terminate the contract, reduce the compensation, claim damages, or
demand reimbursement for her wasted expenditures.[^germany_70] This does not
differ at all from the rights a recipient has against a distributor of
proprietary software.

If, on the other hand, the distributor and the user have come to a valid
agreement concerning the former’s warranties and liability, the terms of
this agreement replace the above provisions.[^germany_71]

#### Relationship right holder — user

As to the relationship between the holder of the exclusive rights and
the licensee, the following mechanism applies: There is no contractual
responsibility for any defects of quality of the software itself. The
right holder does not deliver (in the situation discussed herein) the
software itself but only grants the rights on this software.[^germany_72] Thus,
her responsibility only covers the lack of title. As the grant of rights
is gratuitous, it is governed by the principles of the law of donations.
Hence, the responsibility of the rights owner is, according to BGB, sec.
523, limited to cases where she fraudulently conceals the existence of
third-party rights.[^germany_73]

However, it should be noted that in a case where the licensor is
situated in a country other than Germany, the laws of that country will
most probably apply (see art. 4 para 2 of the so-called Rome I
regulation[^germany_74]).

#### Product liability

Apart from the contractual liability explained above, software
developers and distributors can also be subject to the principles of
product liability as set forth in the German Product Liability Act[^germany_75].
This act provides for direct damages claims against the producer of a
product if the product is defective, and the defect causes the death or
bodily injury of someone, or damages a thing other than the defective
product itself that is used for private purposes (sec. 1 para 1). Claims
for financial loss are not covered by the German Product Liability Act.
Defects are defined in terms of the lack of safety the product provides
(sec. 3), which deviates significantly from general private law.

Whether or not product liability applies depends on whether the
developer or distributor are “producers”, as defined by sec. 4 of the
Product Liability Act. According to this provision, a producer is the
person or entity who has made the product, who uses a distinctive sign
giving the impression that she is the maker of the product, or who
imports the product into the European Economic Area in order to
distribute it for commercial purposes. Hence, both developers and
distributors of FOSS can in principle be regarded as producers in terms
of the Product Liability Act. However, pursuant to sec. 1 para 2 no. 3,
the liability under this act is excluded if the respective product was
neither made for sale or any other form of commercial distribution, nor
made or distributed as part of the professional activities of the
producer.

Claims under the Product Liability Act may not be waived or limited in
advance; any agreements to the contrary effect are void.

#### Torts

Finally, producers and distributors of FOSS may also be liable under the
general law of torts (BGB, sec. 823 ff.). Liability under sec. 823 para
1 of the Civil Code — the fundamental torts provision — requires that
the tortfeasor at least acted negligently. In this context, it is
important that according to the Federal Court of Justice, the liability
limitations of the law on donations under BGB, sec. 521 (liability only
for intent and gross negligence) also apply to the law of torts, as long
as a parallel donor-donee relationship existed between both sides.[^germany_76]

Moreover, BGB, sec. 823 para 1 also requires that a so-called absolute
right was infringed. Such rights include life, body, health, freedom,
and property. Most likely, tort claims from the delivery of defective
FOSS will arise because of damages to property and bodily injuries.[^germany_77]

### The copyleft principle

#### Principle

A common feature of many FOSS licenses is the “copyleft” principle. This
term means that any licensee is obligated to put derivate works that she
creates based on the licensor’s work under the same license obligations
as the original work if she distributes the derivative work.

#### Validity

As clear and simple as this principle appears, it is very difficult in
its practical application. The main issue is how to define what
constitutes a derivative work or — in copyright terms — what UrhG, sec.
69c no. 2 means by “adaptation, arrangement and any other alteration of
a computer program.” The answer to this question is particularly
important for cases where the code of the original work is not itself
modified, but where the original program is combined with other programs
or program components. There is no case law on this problem,[^germany_78] and
literature dealing with this issue is scarce. One proposal brought
forward in the literature with regard to the implementation of the
Software Directive is to apply the rather formal criteria of whether or
not the new software uses an interface to communicate with the original
one.[^germany_79]

Even though the question of what constitutes an adaptation or alteration
of a computer program thus remains largely open, it is fair to say that
the copyleft principle as such is valid under German law; right holders
are allowed to make their grants subject to the compliance with certain
requirements.

In the same context, a further issue should be mentioned. Existing
copyleft licenses provide for various wordings and can consequently be
different in their scope. This can, at least in theory, be a legal issue
if a copyleft obligation is put on the recipient of the software even
for cases where copyright law does not require her to obtain a license
for moving forward with her own programming. For most copyleft licenses,
this is not a real issue, however.[^germany_80] On the other hand, sec. 2 of the
GPLv2 could be interpreted in such a way that its definition of the term
“derivative work” goes beyond what is covered by UrhG, sec. 69c no. 2
(the exclusive right to alter the software), when it states that even
independent sections that are distributed as part of a whole have to be
licensed under the GPLv2 if one of them is GPLv2 software. Nevertheless,
this does not necessarily mean that this GPL provision goes any further
than what German copyright law requires. The reason is that not only the
alteration of a work but also the distribution of several works as
compound works under UrhG, sec. 9 requires each right holder’s
consent.[^germany_81] However, the impact of sec. 2 of the GPLv2 on cases where
one could neither argue that the program at hand was altered nor that a
compound work was created (if this is possible at all) depends on the
circumstances of the concrete situation.

### Claims against infringing acts. Damages

Practical experience has shown that the GPLv2 can be enforced in Germany
without major difficulties.[^germany_82]

Under German law, copyright infringements can trigger a number of
statutory claims, the most important one being the right to compel the
infringer to refrain from further infringing acts. Such a claim requires
that there is the danger that the infringer commits further infringing
acts, which normally is presumed on the basis of the
pre-infringement.[^germany_83] In contrast, it is not required that the
infringer acts intentionally or at least negligently.

Moreover, the right holder may also require the infringer to abolish
anything interfering with the right holder’s rights.

An infringed party may also bring forward a claim for destruction or
surrender of unlawfully manufactured or distributed copies or of all
copies intended for unlawful distribution (UrhG, sec. 69f para 1).[^germany_84]

Furthermore, UrhG, sec. 101 stipulates that any injured party may
require from any person who infringes on her copyright in the course of
business to give information as to the origin and distribution channels
of such copies.

Finally, UrhG, sec. 97 para 1 sentence 1, 3rd case provides for claims
for damages. In contrast to cease and desist claims, damages claims
require fault on the part of the infringer. Hence, the infringer must
have caused the infringement intentionally or at least negligently. It
is sufficient if the infringer could have known and should have known
that she is infringing on someone else’s copyright.[^germany_85] German courts
tend to be rather strict (for instance, requiring that a software
distributor control the license chain) and will in most cases assume
that an infringer acted at least negligently.

Three ways of determining the amount of damages are established: the
actual damages including lost profits; payment of the equivalent of an
appropriate license fee; or an account of profits. The infringed right
holder has a choice among these three methods.

In cases of dual licensing, it is a reasonable option to choose the
second method of damage calculation because in such cases the infringed
party is able to prove how much she would normally charge licensees for
exploitation rights in the software. In other cases, it is more
advisable for FOSS owners to claim an account of profits. However, this
option is also potentially problematic if the infringed party holds only
rights to a derived work.[^germany_86]

An interesting feature of the law on damages can be found in UrhG, sec.
97 para 2. Under this provision, right owners can ask for
indemnification for immaterial damages that is, the infringement of
moral rights. One example might be the distribution of a computer
program without naming the author. Another possibility would be that
someone who is not the true author poses as such. However,
indemnifications for the violation of moral rights are in practice
rather rare and come into consideration mostly in very serious cases.

## Legal procedures

### Standing to sue

The first issue that must be dealt with regarding procedural law is the
question of who is entitled to sue. In most FOSS cases there is not only
one right owner in the infringed program, because most software in
general, and FOSS in particular, is the product of collaboration between
many developers and later further development by others. As described
above, rights in FOSS can be owned by joint authors, by original
authors, by authors of derivative works, and by authors of compound
works. Who in these cases is in a position to enforce the copyrights in
the computer program?

#### Joint authors

According to UrhG, sec. 8 para 2 sentence 3, each joint author of a work
may enforce the exclusive rights in this work. However, she may demand
payment only on behalf of all joint authors. In other words, she may go
to court and ask for a decision that compels the infringer to refrain
from the infringing acts, but she must ask for the payment of damages
for the benefit of every joint author. Thus, when filing her action, she
has to name every co-author of the work whose rights were infringed
upon.[^germany_87] The size and diversity of developer communities involved in
the development of computer programs can make this an extremely
difficult task. However, the prerequisite of following a common idea
when creating a program in order to justify the classification as joint
authors limits quite significantly the number of developers who have to
be considered; as a consequence, it is in most cases not impossible to
prepare an exhaustive list of all joint authors.

#### Compound works

For compound works, the Copyright Act does not contain a provision
similar to sec. 8 para 2 sentence 3. The most reasonable rule one could
apply should be to let each author enforce the rights in her own
creation.

#### Derivative works

As described above, the situation is different for derivative works.
Both the creator of the original work and the author of the derived work
hold by law a full right in their respective work. Both are therefore
entitled to institute proceedings against any infringer on their rights.
However, the derivative work’s author may not create or exploit any
derivative works without the original author’s consent.

This being said, German doctrine applies UrhG, sec. 8 para 2 sentence 3
by analogy to certain situations involving derivative works. The creator
of the derivative work is hence permitted to ask for injunctive relief
against any acts infringing on the work, even if the part concerned was
not created by her but the original author. On the other hand, she may
ask for damages only insofar as the part of the work she created herself
is concerned.[^germany_88] This can lead to severe, almost insurmountable
problems regarding the calculation of the damages.

### Courses of action

If right holders wish to receive injunctive relief from a court, German
law requires them to first institute out-of-court-proceedings: Right
holders must first contact the infringers directly, demand that they
cease and desist from the infringing acts, and enter into a cease and
desist agreement with a sufficient contractual penalty for every case of
violating the agreement. Sec. 97a of the Copyright Act only uses the
verb “should”, thereby leaving it up to the infringed person to decide
whether she wants to deal with the matter out of court first. However,
if the right holder starts direct court action, she risks having to bear
all the costs of the court proceedings, including those of the
infringer, if the infringer immediately acknowledges in court the claims
brought forward against her.[^germany_89] This explains why, in practice,
injured parties will almost always first send out a cease and desist
letter. Moreover, it is important to know that the infringer is
obligated to reimburse the infringed party for all necessary costs she
incurred for the enforcement of her rights, including the statutory
legal fees incurred for an attorney sending a formal cease and desist
letter (UrhG, sec. 97a para 3 sentence 1).

As mentioned above, injunctive relief can only be sought if there is a
danger that the infringer will repeat the infringing acts in the future.
German courts interpret the previous commission of certain infringing
acts as the basis for a presumption in favor of the existence of such
danger. This presumption can only be overcome out of court by entering
into the afore-mentioned cease and desist agreement that includes the
enforceable promise to pay a contractual penalty for any future
infringing acts of the same nature. Thus, if the infringer issues such a
declaration, any filing for injunctive relief in the same matter will
have no success. If, however, the infringer refuses to sign a sufficient
declaration to cease and desist, the infringed party may seek injunctive
relief.

The right holder has two options for such court actions: filing for a
preliminary injunction or instituting the main proceedings. In IP
matters, it is common to ask for a preliminary injunction, as this is a
fast and relatively cheap way to get help from a court.[^germany_90] However,
preliminary injunctions require that the matter be urgent. Even though
there is no strict rule as to when a matter is considered urgent, most
courts usually refuse to issue a preliminary injunction if the infringed
party has waited for more than one, at most two months after learning
about the infringement before going to court. A preliminary injunction,
if granted without prior hearing, [^germany_91] is normally issued within a few
days after the request was submitted to the court.[^germany_92] The main
proceedings, in contrast, can take from a few months up to considerably
more than a year, and that does not even take into account the first
right of appeal. After the issuance of a preliminary injunction, the
defendant often signs a formal declaration that the matter shall be
fully resolved with this injunction with the effect that no further
court action against her in this matter would be admissible.[^germany_93]

As to the costs involved in litigation, it is important to know that
under German law, the losing party is obligated to reimburse the
prevailing one for its reasonable expenses according to the statutory
scales of attorney’s and court fees.[^germany_94] Moreover, when filing a
complaint with a court, the plaintiff has to pay the court fees in
advance; for preliminary injunctions this is not required, however. The
expenses that are subject of reimbursement claims are determined
according to a statutory scale of attorney’s and court fees and depend
on the value in dispute. In FOSS cases the courts have so far assumed
values in dispute between EUR 100,000 and EUR 250,000. On this basis,
the financial risk a party bears for the case of loss in one instance
ranges from roughly EUR 9,000 to EUR 12,000 if no oral hearing is
involved (as often in preliminary injunction cases), and from EUR 12,000
to EUR 21,000 if an oral hearing takes place.

## FOSS cases in Germany

As FOSS is a relatively recent phenomenon, case law is still limited
internationally. In some landmark decisions, however, German courts left
no room for any doubts that FOSS licenses are enforceable. As a
consequence, most cases where FOSS right holders start proceedings
against infringers are resolved before even entering the court
stage.[^germany_95]

### Welte v. Sitecom

In 2004 the first case dealing with the violation of a FOSS license was
brought before a German court;[^germany_96] the District Court of Munich I
(Landgericht München I) was asked by the right owner of an infringed
software program to grant a preliminary injunction to safeguard his
interests. The factual core of the matter was that the producer and
distributor of a W-LAN router distributed this router and made available
its firmware containing certain Linux kernel programs, which are
licensed under the GPLv2, without accompanying it with the GPLv2 text
and the complete corresponding source code or a written offer to provide
the source code on request as required by sec. 1 and 3 of the GPLv2.

The court had to address a couple of important issues: What is the
general quality of the GPLv2? Was the GPLv2 validly entered into between
the parties? Was it conflicting with the law on standard business terms
and, if yes, with what consequences? What are the consequences of a
GPLv2 violation: Is it a mere breach of contract, or does it constitute
a copyright infringement?

The first important statement the court made was that the use of the
GPLv2 did not mean that the right holders had waived any of their
copyrights: instead, they had used the means of copyright in order to
ensure that their work was used, distributed, and further developed
according to their ideas and plans.[^germany_97]

The court also held that the GPLv2 constituted standard business terms
as governed by BGB, sec. 305 ff. The court found that they had become
part of the agreement between the plaintiff as the right holder and the
defendant. The court dedicated the most extensive analysis to the
discussion of sec. 4 of the GPLv2, which stipulates that any violation
of the license’s conditions terminates the grant of rights set out in
the agreement. The court held that this provision did not place the
licensee at an unreasonable disadvantage and was therefore not in
conflict with BGB, sec. 307.[^germany_98] Sec. 4 of the GPLv2 constituted a
valid condition subsequent, pursuant to BGB, sec. 158 para 2.
Consequently, any breach of the license conditions led to the loss of
the rights a licensee had received, thereby causing any license
violation to be at the same time also an infringement of the licensor’s
copyrights.[^germany_99] Finally, even if one assumed that sec. 4 GPLv2 went
beyond the boundaries of what BGB, sec. 307 allowed, the defendant would
have infringed on the plaintiff’s exclusive rights: In this case, no
license at all would have been granted to the former with the
consequence that also in this case they would have infringed on the
latter’s copyrights.[^germany_100]

The preliminary injunction was granted and accepted by the defendant.

### Welte v. D-Link

The fundamental holdings of the *Sitecom* case were reaffirmed in 2006
by the District Court of Frankfurt/Main (Landgericht Frankfurt/Main),
which was asked by the plaintiff, this time in main proceedings, to
order the defendant to reimburse the plaintiff for the enforcement costs
incurred and to provide him with information about the distribution of
the infringing products.[^germany_101] The facts the court had to decide about
were the following: A subsidiary of a Taiwanese consumer electronics
producer distributed a network media storage device whose firmware
contained the Linux kernel. However, the device was distributed without
GPLv2 license text or warranty waiver and without releasing the complete
corresponding source code. The plaintiff held the exclusive rights in
three of the Linux kernel programs and had sent the defendant a warning
letter demanding a sufficient cease and desist declaration. The
defendant had done accordingly, but refused to reimburse the plaintiff
for the expenses he had incurred for the enforcement of his rights (test
purchase, software engineering costs, attorney’s fees) and to disclose
information concerning the distribution channels of the infringing
products. In order to assess the plaintiff’s claims, the court had to
enter into an in-depth analysis of GPL-related issues similar to those
discussed in the *Sitecom* case.

In this case, the court emphasized once again that the use of the GPLv2
could not be interpreted as a waiver of any rights the holder of the
exclusive rights was awarded by law. It confirmed the classification of
the GPLv2 as standard business terms and held that sec. 4 of the license
provided for a condition subsequent, making every license violation a
copyright infringement.[^germany_102] Besides the issue of
exhaustion[^germany_103] — the court justly found that the plaintiff’s rights
were not exhausted, as the copies had not been lawfully put on the
market[^germany_104] — it also raised the question whether the GPLv2 conflicted
with antitrust law, in particular with the prohibition of price fixing
and of fixing the conditions of the contracts the co-contractor enters
into with her customers. The court argued that the question did not need
to be answered, as either answer would have no effect on the assessment
of the legal situation regarding the defendant’s acts. The defendant
would in any event have needed to be granted a license; a finding of a
violation of antitrust law, however, would not have this effect, as it
would only void the GPLv2 itself, without providing any exploitation
rights in the programs used.[^germany_105]

### Welte v. Skype

Another GPLv2 case clarified the question of whether it was sufficient
to simply present a link to a website in order to provide the license
text and the source code if the software was distributed offline and not
online.[^germany_106] The facts were the following: The defendant’s (Skype
Technologies SA) website had served as a platform for offering not only
voice over IP (VOIP) software but also VOIP hardware of different kinds.
Several producers and distributors used it as a marketing means. One of
the devices, a VOIP phone by SMC Networks, contained firmware with the
Linux kernel, but was delivered without the license text of the GPLv2
and without the source code or an offer to provide the source code on
request. The plaintiff first sent a cease and desist letter to SMC
Networks, whereupon the latter began to put a leaflet in the phone
packages that informed customers about the possibility to access both
the terms of the GPL or GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) and the
source code on their website. They did not sign a cease and desist
declaration. The plaintiff sent another warning letter to the owner of
the website where the phones were offered (Skype Technologies SA). Skype
itself also did not sign a sufficient declaration to refrain from
assisting in the distribution of the phone as long as the distribution
was not in compliance with the GPLv2. The plaintiff filed for a
preliminary injunction with the District Court of Munich I (Landgericht
München I).

The court confirmed that both SMC Networks and Skype had originally
infringed on the plaintiff’s copyright, Skype’s liability being based on
the concept of contributory liability. However, the analysis did not
stop there. The question the court faced now was whether SMC Networks
had entered into a valid license agreement under the GPLv2 with the
plaintiff by continuing the distribution of the VOIP phone with the
aforementioned leaflet added to the packages they sent to their
customers.[^germany_107] In other words: Was it compliant with sec. 1 and 3 of
the GPLv2 to simply indicate a website where people could find both the
license text and the source code? The court’s answer was in the
negative. It based its conclusion on the wording of both license
provisions, which require giving any recipient of the program a copy of
the license text “along with the Program” and “accompany” the program
with its corresponding source code or a written offer for its delivery.
The court held that this clearly showed that in cases of a program’s
offline distribution, GPL compliance could only be achieved if copies of
the license text and the source code (or a written offer) were delivered
to the recipients in the distributed packages themselves.

It should be noted that the defendant appealed the decision mainly for
alleged violation of antitrust law.[^germany_108] However, the defendant
withdrew the appeal after the Munich Court of Appeals (Oberlandesgericht
München) expressed in the hearing its clear intention to uphold the
District Court’s decision, arguing that even in the unlikely case that
the GPLv2 would violate antitrust provisions, such a violation would not
result in releasing a licensee of GPLv2 software from observing the
conditions of the GPLv2.

### FreeAdhocUDF (WISO Mein Büro 2009)

A recent judgment rendered by the District Court of Bochum (Landgericht
Bochum) dealt among other issues with whether the violation of the
conditions of a FOSS license — in this case, the GNU Lesser General
Public License, version 3 — could trigger claims for damages.[^germany_109] The
question arose in the context of an action for disclosure of information
on sales figures regarding the software at issue that had been filed in
order to prepare an action for damages.

The court didn’t show any doubts that LGPLv3 violations could give rise
to claims for damages. Otherwise, the court argued, authors of free
software would practically not be protected against infringements of
their rights. The court found that the damages could be assessed by way
of a license analogy. However, as the damages issue arose only as part
of its analysis of the merits of the information claim, the court did
not discuss how a license analogy could be calculated for software under
a FOSS license. Also, the court did not consider other ways of
determining the damages to be paid (actual damages and skimming of
profits), as the plaintiff had exclusively relied on the license
analogy.

The parties settled the matter in 2012, agreeing on a payment of EUR
15,000 as compensation for the damages suffered.

### AVM v. Cybits

In 2011 the District Court of Berlin (Landgericht Berlin) published a
decision that touched upon more complex questions regarding software
copyright and open source licensing.[^germany_110] The decision was the end
point of a case that had gone through two instances in preliminary
proceedings before reaching the district court in the main proceedings.
For the sake of clarity, the focus here shall be on the final decision
of the District Court.

The plaintiff in the matter was AVM Computersysteme Vertriebs GmbH
(AVM), the biggest German producer and distributor of DSL routers. AVM’s
routers, called “Fritz!Box” used a firmware built around the Linux
kernel. The defendant was Cybits AG (Cybits), a company that distributed
software called “SurfSitter” which consumers could use for modifying the
kernel parts of the Fritz!Box firmware in order to achieve a certain
degree of control over their children’s surfing behavior. AVM’s goal
when instituting the court proceedings was to enjoin Cybits from the
distribution of SurfSitter.[^germany_111] Apparently, no firmware programs
developed by AVM itself were changed by SurfSitter.

The court denied AVM’s copyright claims and ruled that the defendant was
allowed to distribute software consumers may use for changing the
firmware of the plaintiff’s products. However, the court upheld an
auxiliary claim raised by AVM (which was based on unfair competition
law) and banned Cybits from distributing SurfSitter where the use of the
software caused the Fritz!Box web interface to display a wrong status of
the Internet connection and web-filtering software.

The court based its ruling on considerations that were not always
entirely clear but seem to come down to the following:

The court considered the firmware a collective work/compilation of
several programs, including the kernel programs. Therefore, the entire
collective work/compilation fell within the scope of the GPLv2.
Consequently, the plaintiff was barred from relying on the firmware as a
whole as a basis for its copyright claims (“Danach stehen der Klägerin
an der Firmware als Ganzes … keine urheberrechtlichen
Unterlassungsansprüche zu”, which could be translated as “The plaintiff
has no copyrights in the firmware as a whole enabling AVM to ask for
injunctive relief.”). The ruling has come under heavy fire, in
particular because of its nebulous language possibly suggesting that
collective works/compilations with pre-existing GPLv2-licensed
components must always be licensed in their entirety under the GPLv2:
Rather than providing for such far-reaching consequences, section 2 of
the GPLv2 merely prohibits the holder of rights in the collective
work/compilation from compromising any of the users' freedoms to use,
copy, distribute, or modify the pre-existing GPLv2-components. [^germany_112]

However, according to the court, distributing SurfSitter constituted an
act of unfair competition, insofar as causing the routers to display
wrong status messages may confuse the user, which could be detrimental
to AVM’s reputation as the producer of the Fritz!Box.

### Welte v. Fantec

Most recently, the District Court of Hamburg added a few new aspects to
the picture. Fantec, a German company selling various consumer
electronic devices under its Fantec brand, had entered into a cease and
desist agreement with the holder of the exclusive rights in the software
Netfilter/iptables, which is licensed under the GPLv2. According to that
agreement, Fantec promised that it would not make available to the
public the software Netfilter/iptables without being compliant with the
conditions of the GPLv2.[^germany_113] One of these conditions was that
Netfilter/iptables could only be made available to the public in binary
form if the “complete corresponding source code” could be accessed from
the same place, or a written offer was made to hand out that source code
on request. For each case of breaching that obligation, Fantec agreed to
pay a contractual penalty.

Two years later, Fantec was caught distributing a media player with a
Linux-based operating system that included Netfilter/iptables. It also
made the binaries of the firmware available for download. However, the
source code that could also be downloaded from Fantec’s website did not
contain Netfilter/iptables. Moreover, the source code offered was
clearly older than the source used for compilation. When Fantec received
a new cease and desist letter from the right holder, Fantec signed a new
cease and desist declaration but refused to pay (1) the contractual
penalty due under the old cease and desist agreement and (2) the
lawyer’s fees incurred for sending the cease and desist letter.
Moreover, Fantec was not willing to give full information on sales
figures, customers, etc.

The right holder brought an action at the court in Hamburg demanding
payment of the contractual penalty and the legal fees and for full
information. The court decided in the plaintiff’s favor. It held that
Fantec had breached its duty of offering the complete corresponding
source code along with the binary of the software. It emphasized that
Fantec had not met its duty to verify that its products did not infringe
on any third party’s rights and had therefore acted negligently.
Consequently, Fantec was ordered to pay the contractual penalty.
Moreover, the court also confirmed that violating GPLv2 conditions
amounted to copyright infringement and confirmed on this basis that
Fantec had to indemnify the right holder for its legal costs and had to
give the requested information. The court pointed out that by not
including Netfilter/iptables in its source code, Fantec had failed to
comply with its obligation to offer the complete corresponding source
code.

Fantec appealed the decision but withdrew its appeal when the right
holder agreed to waive its right to receive the requested information.

### Xt:commerce

The Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf (Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf)
is responsible for two important decisions dealing with the tricky issue
of using trade marks for FOSS.[^germany_114] In the first of the cases, the
plaintiff owned a word/figurative trade mark containing the phrase
“xt:Commerce” for software, development of software, and software
support. It distributed a computer program that was licensed under the
GNU General Public License, using the name “xt:Commerce”. The defendant
offered on the market, inter alia, its own reproductions of the
xt:Commerce software, also using that name. The plaintiff, relaying on
its trade mark, asked the court to enjoin the defendant from doing so.
The court granted the relief sought, arguing that the GPL only conveyed
licenses under copyright, but not under trade mark law. If someone
desired to distribute her own copies of GPL software, she may do so
under the GPL, but only under a name that did not infringe on third
parties' trade mark rights.

### Enigma

Two years later, in 2012, the same court addressed some more complex
questions.[^germany_115]

The plaintiff, DP GmbH (DP), was the owner of the community trade mark
“Enigma” which is protected for operating systems, drivers,
set-top-boxes, satellite receivers, and digital TV receivers. Its sister
company, DM GmbH (DM), distributed set top boxes whose firmware was
based on GNU/Linux. DM developed its own user interface, published it
under the name “Enigma” and licensed it under the GNU General Public
License, version 2 (GPLv2). Since 2006, DM had distributed a new version
of this user interface, called “Enigma 2.” “Enigma” and “Enigma 2” were
used by numerous manufacturers for their own set top boxes.

The defendant S GmbH distributed a set top box that used Enigma 2, but
with several adaptations to S’s hardware. S advertised its device with
the words “fully equipped HDTV Tuner PVR with Linux Enigma 2 operating
system.” The product description contained the following language: “400
MHz CPU + Linux OS Enigma 2 + Internal HDD (2.5/3.5) + Twin DVB-S2 Tuner
+ E-SATA/ 3 x USB…”. Moreover, when a user clicked on “About,” a window
popped up with information about the precise software status, including
a reference to “Enigma.”

The plaintiff argued that the situation described above infringed its
community trade mark. The Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf disagreed
and provided the following arguments:

According to the court, S had not used the term “Enigma” as a trade
mark — as required by art. 9 para 1 b) of the Community Trade Mark
Regulation (CTMR) — but only as the title of the work (Werktitel[^germany_116]).
Using “Enigma 2” as described above thus did not indicate the origin of
the software. Rather, consumers understood this as a necessary
identifier of the software itself.

The court continued that in any event, the way S had used the term
“Enigma 2” would be permitted by art. 12 b) of the CTMR: The title
“Enigma 2” was used by S in order to inform (potential) customers about
the characteristics of their products. Moreover, as the software
“Enigma” / “Enigma 2” was utilized by numerous companies under the
license conditions of the GPLv2, the relevant public had gotten used to
“Enigma” being the name of a certain software product associated with a
wider range of sources.

Even if customers did not have this understanding of the term “Enigma”
the prerequisites of art. 12 b) of the CMTR would have been met, the
court held. Under the GPLv2, S was allowed to reproduce the work called
“Enigma” / “Enigma 2”. In such a case, S must also be permitted to
identify this work, which can only be done by using its name. Here, the
court used an interesting analogy to an older decision of the BGH: In
2000, the BGH had held that once a work had entered the public domain,
anyone was permitted to use this work’s title, even if this title was
registered as a trade mark.[^germany_117] According to the Düsseldorf court, the
situation is similar when a work may be used by anyone under a free
license.

The court went even further and held that use of the trade marked
software title could also be justified if the software was — to a
certain degree — modified. The court recognized that software may not be
used on different types of hardware without being subject to some
adaptations. Therefore, the use of its (trademarked) title should even
be lawful when the program had been adjusted to the technical
environment it was used in. Even making use of the software title for a
program with certain new functions would be covered by art. 12 b) CTMR,
as long as the essential functions of the original software were
sustained, and pre-existing third-party plug-ins still worked with the
software.

Importantly, the court emphasized that the principles stated above apply
only so long as the user meets all the license conditions of the GPLv2.
Otherwise, using the trademarked title would not be in accordance with
honest practices in industrial or commercial matters.

Moreover, it should be noted that the ruling covers only the simple use
of a work title as an indispensable identifier of the software used;
therefore, the principles above cannot justify any form of use going
beyond the narrow scope described in the decision.

### Other cases

In a number of other cases, German courts have granted preliminary
injunctions against producers and distributors of products that violated
the GPLv2 terms. Apart from one case[^germany_118] the decisions generally do
not provide an explanation of the court reasoning, as is often the case
in preliminary injunction proceedings. The exception mentioned did not
add anything new from a doctrinal perspective, but confirmed a few of
the arguments set forth above: most importantly, that sec. 4 GPLv2 leads
to an automatic loss of any rights of use in case of license violations;
that even if the GPLv2 was not part of an agreement between the parties,
no rights would be granted to the infringer; and that the right holder’s
rights were not exhausted since the first distribution of the copies at
hand had occurred without his consent.

    non-exclusive exploitation right without consideration to the world
    at large” (translation by A. Dietz, 2004 IIC 842, 844) so that
    authors that choose to put software under a FOSS license cannot rely

[^germany_87]: However, it is not required that all authors become a party to

[^germany_88]: JAEGER/METZGER, OSS, ref. 167.

[^germany_89]: According to sec. 93 of the German Civil Procedure Code, the
    defendant can acknowledge the rights of the plaintiff and does not
    have to bear the costs of the action provided that she has not given
    reason to sue.

[^germany_90]: It should be noted that the defendant can ask the court in the
    preliminary proceedings to require the plaintiff to file for a
    regular action. If the plaintiff does not follow this order, or if
    the main proceedings show that the defendant had not infringed on
    the plaintiff’s rights, the preliminary injunction is annulled.

[^germany_91]: In which case the order issued does not contain a written
    explanation of the reasons the court built its decision on.

[^germany_92]: The opponent can file an objection to have the case remanded. If
    the applicant has provided the court with incorrect facts in order
    to obtain a preliminary injunction, she risks being ordered to pay
    damages according to sec. 945 ZPO (Zivilprozessordnung — Code of
    Civil Procedure).

[^germany_93]: Called the Abschlussschreiben (conclusion letter) and
    Abschlusserklärung (conclusion declaration). The defendant in
    particular must make the legally binding promise to refrain from
    appealing the decision in any way.
