## Introduction to software protection under Belgian law

### Body of law

Copyright protection of software is regulated in Belgium under the
Software Act of 30 June 1994[^belgium_1]. This law transposes the Council
Directive of 14 May 1991 on the Legal Protection of computer programs
(91/250/EEC) into Belgian national law (hereinafter referred to as the
“Software Directive”)[^belgium_2]. The Software Act is the lex specialis with
respect to the general Belgian Copyright Act as lex generalis[^belgium_3]. This
means that the general Copyright Act will apply to software, to the
extent that the Software Act does not contain any specific provisions.

### Software Act: Object of protection

Computer programs (including the preparatory material[^belgium_4]) are protected
by copyright and are equivalent to literary works within the meaning of
the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic
Works[^belgium_5]. According to article 2 of the Software Act only original
computer programs benefit copyright protection. Computer programs that
are not original don’t benefit copyright protection. The ideas and
principles behind computer programs or technical interfaces are
explicitly denied copyright protection[^belgium_6].

The originality requirement means that the computer program needs to be
an own intellectual creation of the author. No other criteria may be
used to determine whether the program can be subject to copyright
protection[^belgium_7]. There is no legal definition of the originality
requirement. Legal doctrine established that the amount of work involved
is not relevant. A computer program is only deemed to be the own
intellectual creation of the author if the personal stamp of the author
is visible in the work. Therefore it is required, but not sufficient,
that the author has freedom of choice when he creates his work. If the
author has no choice but following a path that leads to one single
outcome, no originality is involved. Thus, merely registering or copying
the reality or executing a functional routine is not considered to be an
original intellectual activity in the sense of the Copyright Act[^belgium_8].
Where Belgian legal doctrine stresses the need that the personal
contribution of the author must be sufficiently intensive (“Le droit
d’auteur ne devrait s’appliquer qu'à des créations qui révèlent un
niveau d’inventivité personnelle d’une certain intensité”[^belgium_9]), they
agree that the threshold as applied by the courts is fairly low[^belgium_10].

### Authors/Beneficiaries

The general Copyright Act provides that the copyrights on a work belong
to the author, whether the author is an employee or not[^belgium_11]. Article 3
of the Software Act however, provides that where computer programs are
created by one or more employees or functionaries in the execution of
their duties or following the instructions given by their employer, the
employer will be deemed to be the right-holder of the economic rights in
the computer programs so created, unless expressly provided
otherwise[^belgium_12].

Article 2.3 of the Software Directive provides that “the employer
exclusively shall be entitled to exercise all economic rights”. The
wording “entitled to exercise” creates a certain ambiguity: is the
employer the owner of the economic rights or merely the mandatory of his
employees? Case law confirmed that the Belgian lawmaker has chosen for
the first interpretation[^belgium_13].

### Exclusive rights

According to article 5 of the Software Act the economic rights comprise
the exclusive right of (a) the permanent or temporary reproduction of a
computer program by any means and in any form, in part or in whole, (b)
translation, adaptation, arrangement or alteration of a computer
program, and (c) distribution of the computer program, including the
rental and lending, of the original computer program or copies thereof
to the public. This is a slight diversion of the Software Directive, as
article 4(c) of the Software Directive only mentions the rental of
computer programs.

### Exceptions to exclusive rights

Article 5(c) of the law expressly provides that the first sale in the
European Community of a copy of a program by the rightholder or with his
consent shall exhaust the distribution right of that copy within the
Community, with the exception of the right to control further rental of
the program or a copy thereof.

The other exceptions are set forth in article 6 of the Software Act:

(1) In the absence of specific contractual provisions, no authorization
by the rightholder is required for acts necessary for the use of the
computer program by the lawful acquirer in accordance with its intended
purpose, including error correction.

(2) The reproduction by way of a back-up copy by a person having a right
to use the computer program may not be prevented, insofar as that copy
is necessary to use the program.

(3) The person having a right to use a copy of a computer program is
entitled, without the authorization of the rightholder, to observe,
study or test the functioning of the program in order to determine the
ideas and principles which underlie any element of the program if he
does so while lawfully performing any of the acts of loading,
displaying, running, transmitting or storing the program.

This article basically restates the three exceptions of article 5 of the
Software Directive.

Article 7 of the law explains in detail in which circumstances no
authorization of the right holder is required to reproduce and/or
translate a computer program in order to obtain the information
necessary to achieve the interoperability of an independently created
computer program with other programs[^belgium_14].

The law expressly provides that article 6, section 2 and 3 and article 7
are compulsory law[^belgium_15]. Hence, contractual provisions to the contrary
are deemed not to exist.

However, the exercise of these statutory rights is often difficult in
practice because the licensee generally has no access to the source code
of the application and it is not obvious to enforce access legally[^belgium_16].

### Moral rights

Article 4 of the Software Act specifies that the moral rights on
software are regulated by article 6bis 1 of the Berner Convention. This
Convention acknowledges a minimum protection, namely the paternity right
and the right to oppose to modifications and applications which might
affect the honor or reputation of the author[^belgium_17]. These two rights
remain in force after the transfer of the proprietary rights[^belgium_18] and
following the death of the author, at least[^belgium_19] until after expiry of
the proprietary rights[^belgium_20].

The right of distribution has not been specified in the convention[^belgium_21].
Nevertheless, some authors argue that this right also must be recognised
as a moral right on software[^belgium_22] as in the absence of a specific
regulation in the Software Act, the general regime[^belgium_23] for literary
works needs to be applied.

Moral rights are generally considered to be inalienable. This does not
mean that it is impossible to renounce moral rights[^belgium_24]. It means that
the global renouncement of the future exercise of moral rights is void,
also concerning moral rights on software[^belgium_25]. However, some authors
wonder whether the principle inalienability of moral rights is desirable
for technological applications such as software[^belgium_26].

### Term of protection

The same term as for works of literature and art applies: 70 years as of
January 1 following the death of the author[^belgium_27]. In case of co-authors,
the protection of the work lasts until 70 years as of January 1
following the death of the longest living author.

### Copyright assignment

The law[^belgium_28] provides that the copyrights in works (other than software)
made by employees in the course of the execution of their usual tasks
are not automatically transferred to the employer. A written clause
stipulating the transfer in the individual employment contract, the
applicable statute or collective agreement is required. If the transfer
relates to the exploitation of the work in a form that is still unknown,
the employee is entitled to a share in the gain. Article 3 of the
Software Act however, provides that where computer programs are created
by one or more employees or functionaries in the execution of their
duties or following the instructions given by their employer, the
employer will be deemed by law to be the right-holder of the economic
rights in the computer programs so created, unless expressly provided
otherwise in a contract[^belgium_29]. The moral rights are not transferred.

The exploitation rights on works can be freely transferred, e.g. in case
of works made for hire. However, contracts on the transfer of copyrights
do have some particularities under Belgian law. First of all, they must
be in writing and be clear. When a clause is unclear, it will be
explained restrictively and to the advantage of the author. The extent
of the transfer (what rights, duration, methods of exploitation and
compensation) needs to be described. Another particularity is that the
assignment of rights in future works is only valid for a limited period
in time[^belgium_30]. A transfer of copyrights in future works that is
temporally unlimited is not valid. Therefore under Belgian law, the
wording “for the entire term of copyright protection” is more effective
than “temporally unlimited”. Further it is mandatory to stipulate the
genre of the work that is the subject matter of the transfer[^belgium_31]. The
term genre is ambiguous and often leads to confusion. Is it meant to
serve in a peer-to-peer environment, strictly on a mobile device, or
merely as documentation? All these exploitation methods and uses of the
same work may qualify as different genres under Belgian law and should
be named in the agreement. The transfer of rights with respect to still
unknown exploitation methods is void under Belgian law[^belgium_32].

In order to control the copyright situation better, it may be useful to
collect all copyrights concerning a FOSS project within one
organisation.

### Special measures

The Software Act refers to the general Copyright Act regarding the
measures to enforce copyrights. Besides these general measures, a
specific criminal sanction has been created for those who bring into
trade or possess for commercial purposes a copy of a computer program,
of which they know or can reasonably presume that it concerns an
unlawful copy, as well as for those who bring into trade or possess for
commercial purposes tools which are exclusively aimed at facilitating
the unlawful removal or avoidance of technical means which protect the
computer program[^belgium_33].

## Unprotected software and public domain software

As set forth above, only software that is original in the sense that it
is an intellectual creation of the author benefits copyright protection.
Non-original software does not come into consideration for copyright
protection and can, in principle, be used freely[^belgium_34].

Under Belgian law, public domain software is considered as software to
which the author has given up all rights and on which nobody is able to
enforce any rights. This software can be used, reproduced or executed
freely, without permission or the payment of a fee[^belgium_35]. Public domain
software can in certain cases even be presented by third parties as own
work, and by modifying the original work, third parties can take certain
versions of the public domain software out of the public domain
again[^belgium_36].

Legal theory states that the author of FOSS, contrary to the author of
public domain software, has in no way whatsoever given up his rights on
his work[^belgium_37]. FOSS supports on the rights of the author (the copyright)
to impose FOSS license conditions[^belgium_38]. Under Belgian law, FOSS is
considered as software to which users generally receive more rights via
their license agreement, than they would normally have with a
proprietary software license[^belgium_39]. However, the FOSS license conditions
need to be respected by the user.

## Analysis of FOSS under Belgian law

The FOSS license deviates so much from conventional license agreements
that under Belgian law it needs to be considered as a sui generis
license agreement[^belgium_40]. However, it is still based on the same
mechanisms.

### Copyrights

Although FOSS can be written by one person or be owned by one legal
entity[^belgium_41], generally speaking, after some time the software is the
result of the work of several authors who can make claims to it. The
question is whether later additions create a collaborative work (a work
created by collaborating authors), or whether the original software is
the end work and every contribution created during the further
development of the software, a derivative work. The legal consequences
are different.

### Qualification of FOSS

For it to be work that was created following collaboration it is not
necessary for every co-author to have contributed equally[^belgium_42]. In the
case of FOSS this is rarely the case. Nor is it required that the
co-authors worked on it at the same time. In most cases this will not be
the case. However, to be a co-author, the contribution needs to be
copyright protected. The provider of an idea is not a co-author, nor the
person who corrects a technical error or merely follows
instructions[^belgium_43].

It is also necessary that the work was made by two or more people who
created the software in consultation, from the same mind. Prof.
Berenboom[^belgium_44] summarises it as follows: *The thing that characterises a
co-author is the intimate entanglement ('intimité*) of his contribution
with the contributions of other authors, which is expressed by the
indispensable character in the entire work: without this contribution
the work would certainly not have seen the light of day, and it would
have been different.'

Whereas the first version of the software, if written by several people,
can in many cases be qualified as a work created following a
collaboration, this seems much less the case for the later versions,
which are based on the original work, without, however, there being any
“consultation” between the authors. These later versions will be
qualified as derivative works. Therefore, in terms of the legal
consequences, a distinction needs to be made between the rights of the
original co-authors and the rights of people who carry on based on the
original work.

#### Rights of the original co-authors

Unless the components of the software can be clearly distinguished, it
usually concerns “indivisible works”[^belgium_45]. This concerns work whereby it
cannot be concluded clearly what the individual contribution of every
author is, e.g. when two authors write a text together.

In the case of indivisible works the authors are free to regulate the
exercise of the copyrights by agreement. This freedom goes very
far[^belgium_46]. The co-authors can agree how the program is made public (e.g.
as “FOSS”) and how decisions regarding the copyrights are made, e.g. by
normal or special majorities, or give one of them the right to make all
decisions regarding this work[^belgium_47]. They can also reach all kinds of
agreements relating to the moral rights[^belgium_48], such as under whose name
the work will be published.

If the co-authors have not reached an agreement, neither of the authors
is allowed to exercise the copyright separately. Unanimity is required.
In the absence of unanimity the court decides. The court will decide
equitably and according to custom. The court will take into account good
faith[^belgium_49] and apply it to the (verbal) agreement which in fact
constituted the basis for the collaboration and the production of the
software. You don’t work together accidentally.

Belgian law stipulates one exception. Every author has the right to, in
his name and without intervention of the other authors, institute legal
proceedings for an infringement of copyright and demand damages for his
part[^belgium_50]. This right also implies the right to stop an
infringement[^belgium_51]. However, in some cases the lack of unanimity may
result in the inadmissibility of this claim, e.g. if heirs of a
programmer are unable to agree as to whether to institute a claim[^belgium_52].

#### Authors of derivative works

After some time FOSS will, in most cases, be a derivative work or a
composed work. Derivative works and composed works are works the
originality of which is supported on existing work(s), of which original
characteristics are copied[^belgium_53].

The author(s) of the derivative or composed work are the only persons
with a copyright on their work. This is an independent and full
copyright, which is restricted, however, because the derivative or
composed work cannot be operated without the consent of the holder of
the copyright on the original work. For usual FOSS licenses this consent
is not a problem, subject to respecting the terms and conditions (e.g.
regarding further distribution of the derivative work)[^belgium_54]. Both
authors can enforce their own copyrights in court.

#### The assignment of copyrights

In order to control the copyright situation better, it may be useful to
collect all copyrights concerning a FOSS project within one
organisation. The existence of this organisation will simplify the
management and enforcing of the joint rights[^belgium_55]. The collective
management of copyrights is perfectly possible under Belgian law, and is
usually, but not necessarily, regulated by the fiduciary transfer of
copyrights. The fiduciary transfer means that the party to whom the
copyrights are assigned shall not act for himself but on account of
others who have transferred the rights (the original authors)[^belgium_56].

### Moral copyrights

FOSS originated in the United States, and therefore attaches less
importance to the moral rights of the author[^belgium_57]. The Open Source
Definition specifies that the author of software distributed under a
FOSS license cannot oppose the use of the software by certain people and
groups[^belgium_58] or for certain areas of application[^belgium_59].

Whether an author is able to give up all his rights on a work is a
difficult question under Belgian law in view of the principal
indefeasibility of the moral rights[^belgium_60]. Although renouncement of moral
rights is possible in principle[^belgium_61], the global renouncement of the
future exercise of moral rights is void, also concerning moral rights on
software[^belgium_62].

The author of a work distributed under the FOSS license shall therefore
probably be able to oppose any use of his work by people or groups or
for certain purposes which affect his honour or reputation, based on his
moral rights.

Moral rights are reflected in derivative works[^belgium_63]. The author of the
original work will therefore, based on his moral rights, not only be
able to oppose the use by third parties of his work, but also the use of
derivative works which affect his honour or reputation.

### Enforcing FOSS licenses

The question whether a FOSS license can be enforced under the Belgian
legal system depends on whether a valid license was issued. The
essential questions are: (i) between whom is a license reached, and (ii)
has the license been validly reached?

#### Contracting parties

If one author makes his work available under a FOSS license, the answer
is clear: the license is reached between the licensee and the author. In
case of different co-authors, it becomes more complicated. With whom the
licensee reaches a contract depends on the mutual agreement between the
co-authors.

In most cases FOSS will be the work of several authors who did not work
in joint consultation. After all, FOSS is usually realised via a chain
of authors who all contributed to the realisation of the program. In so
far a new author makes an original contribution to the work, a
derivative work is produced[^belgium_64]. The licensee of the eventual work will
need to have the consent of every author in the chain who made an
original contribution to the eventual work, starting with the author of
the first work. This consent can be direct, or indirect by giving
consent in the FOSS license to the next author to modify and distribute
the work.

Most FOSS licenses solve this by creating a contractual bond between the
licensee and all authors in the chain[^belgium_65]. GPL version 3, for instance,
contains the following clause: *Each time you convey a covered work, the
recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors,
to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License*[^belgium_66]
and GPL version 2: *each time you redistribute the Program (or any work
based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license
from the original licensor*[^belgium_67].

In this way the user of the software obtains a license of all authors in
the chain. This chain of licenses is valid under Belgian law.

#### Validity of the FOSS licenses

An author chooses a FOSS license because he wants to distribute his work
and make it available to others -possibly with certain restrictions. For
him it is important that he can enforce these restrictions.

Conventional IT agreements are entered into by the explicit acceptance
of the terms and conditions by the licensee following the signing of the
terms and conditions, by opening the packaging, by clicking or selecting
an “I agree” button or by any other action from which acceptance can be
deducted. These methods to reach a licensing agreement have been
sufficiently tried and tested and, at least between commercial parties,
are generally considered to be valid[^belgium_68]. FOSS licenses which were
concluded in the same way will be valid.

Typically, in a FOSS environment, however, software is made available
with the simple specification on a website or in the source code of the
software that it concerns FOSS. The license usually does not need to be
explicitly accepted. Having to click and confirm every time could in
some cases interfere with the use of the software. The Open Source
Definition opposes demanding explicit agreement with the license
conditions with the aim of confirming the agreement between licensor and
licensee[^belgium_69].

The question is whether in these cases a valid license is entered into.
The answer to this question is affirmative[^belgium_70]. The reason is that the
user of a copyright protected work needs to be able to indicate the
grounds on which he is able to use the work. Using the software without
the author’s consent implies a copyright infringement[^belgium_71]. This implies
that everyone who wants to use software which they find via the
internet, needs to actively look for a license. If the user cannot prove
he has a license[^belgium_72], he must refrain from using it. Renouncement of
copyrights is not suspected but needs to be proven. The mere
availability of a work on the internet does not mean it becomes public
domain. It is doubtful whether a user would benefit from disputing the
existence of a FOSS license. If the user disputes the conclusion of the
FOSS license, this implies no legally valid copyright license was
granted and the user therefore is not allowed to use the software[^belgium_73].

However, not all infringements of license agreements are copyright
infringements. An infringement only is a copyright infringement if the
violation affects the exclusive rights of the author protected by
copyright. Violations on clauses that are not based on the exclusive
rights of the author do not consist copyright infringement. Typical
examples hereof are the non-payment of royalties, insufficient
exploitation of the work and the violation of non-competition
obligations[^belgium_74]. These consist mere contractual infringements. This
raises the question of the validity of copyleft clauses: is violation of
the copyleft clause automatically a copyright infringement? The answer
is yes, as set forth under nr. 1.3.5.

### Waiver and liability

Typically, FOSS licenses contain very strong exoneration clauses, which
discharge the author from all liability[^belgium_75]. The reason for this is
that FOSS is often made available without a fee, as a result of which
the author generates insufficient income to pay for liability insurances
and legal costs[^belgium_76]. Although this reasoning is certainly valid for the
amateur programmer, it applies much less for professional programmers
who built their business model around FOSS[^belgium_77]. Professional suppliers
of FOSS or related services often provide guarantees[^belgium_78].

One can wonder whether these exoneration clauses comply with the general
validity requirements under Belgian law. These requirements are: (i)
that the clause does not conflict with public order or compulsory law,
(ii) does not cover up personal fraud or an intentional act of the
debtor and (iii) does not take away every significance of the entered
into obligation or the contract[^belgium_79]. In this sense it is important to
look at how the licensor presents the product. For a product that is
presented as finished and ready for use, the exoneration clause will be
considered invalid much sooner, than for a product for which the
licensor clearly formulated a reservation[^belgium_80].

In so far the three aforementioned conditions have been complied with,
exoneration provisions will be enforceable in principle, unless the
stipulating party could be considered as a professional seller. The
professional seller is deemed to know the defect in the software, and in
pursuance of article 1643 of the Belgian Civil Code, contractual
provisions of non-indemnity for hidden defects have no effect if the
seller knew about the defect at the time of the sale. The professional
seller of FOSS will therefore be liable in principle, unless he can
provide proof of invincible ignorance. In practice this proof will be
hard to provide. The fact that the software was provided for free is no
defence, but it can be part of the proof that the author doesn’t qualify
as a professional seller. However, as also professional sellers provide
software for free, more proof will be needed.

### The copyleft principle

#### Principle

A characteristic found in different (but not all[^belgium_81]) FOSS licenses is
the so-called “copyleft” principle. FOSS licenses which incorporate the
copyleft principle[^belgium_82], lay down by contract that everyone in the chain
of consecutive users, in return for the right of use that is assigned,
needs to distribute the improvements he makes to the software and the
derivative works he makes under the same conditions to other users, if
he chooses to distribute such improvements or derivative works. In other
words, software which incorporates copyleft FOSS, needs to be
distributed in turn as copyleft FOSS. It is not possible to incorporate
copyright protected parts of copyleft software in a proprietary licensed
work.

The copyleft principle can restrict the commercial possibilities of the
software[^belgium_83]. Sometimes warnings are issued for the dangers that
companies run if a negligent or vindictive employee were to incorporate
a piece of copyleft code in the code of proprietary software. In theory
this could mean that the company would be obliged to make its
proprietary software available under a copyleft FOSS license. Although
caution is necessary, one can ask oneself whether these worst-case
scenarios are realistic under Belgian law[^belgium_84]. The sanction for
incorporating copyleft code in proprietary software will usually be
restricted to a prohibition to distribute the software which is in
breach[^belgium_85] or the obligation to remove this piece of code from the
program. If the unlawful use has caused damage to the author, this
damage will need to be reimbursed, but not more than the actually
suffered damage.

#### Validity

The question relating to the validity of the copyleft clause coincides
with the question whether an author is able to validly lay down how
derivative works need to be distributed. The answer to this question is
affirmative. The author of the original work has no rights on the
derivative work, but based on his rights on the original work is able to
permit or prohibit the distribution of the derivative work. A derivative
work can therefore only be operated subject to the consent of the
copyright owner of the original work. The Visscher and Michaux phrased
this as follows: *L’auteur ou les auteurs de l’oeuvre dérivée sont donc
“pieds et mains liés” vis-à-vis du ou des auteurs de l’oeuvre
première*[^belgium_86].

Based on his copyrights an author is entitled to lay down the use of his
work for a particular use, or link certain conditions to it. This right
to determine the destination of a work was recognised in legal
theory[^belgium_87] based on an interpretation of article 1 of the old Belgian
Copyright Act of 22 March 1886. As the old article 1 is an almost
literal copy of article 1 of the current Copyright Act, this legal
theory also remains valid under the new Copyright Act[^belgium_88]. The right to
determine the destination not only applies inter partes, but erga
omnes[^belgium_89], provided that the third parties, in all reasonableness,
should know what the destination is[^belgium_90]. The author can therefore lay
down the copyleft condition based on his right to determine the
destination of his work.

Certain authors claim that FOSS doesn’t need the right of destination
for its validity as the author can enforce the FOSS license directly on
his economic copyrights[^belgium_91]. Even though there is a certain merit in
this reasoning, one must be cautious. A license infringement does not
automatically imply a copyright infringement as this reasoning seems to
imply. The non-payment of royalties e.g. is not a copyright
infringement, but a “mere” contractual infringement[^belgium_92]. The right of
destination is a useful tool to explain why the copyleft clause touches
the exclusive rights of the author[^belgium_93]. The right of destination has
its use in explaining the extent of the economical copyrights of the
author. The right of destination is not a new right, but is part of the
economical copyrights set out in article 1 of the Copyright Act[^belgium_94].

All rights are subject to abuse, including the copyright. An author can
therefore not randomly exercise his economic and moral rights. A lawful
tangible or moral interest needs to be proven. However, exercising his
copyrights cannot be considered as an abuse of rights as such. Only in
exceptional cases will an author who invokes his copyrights be guilty of
an abuse of rights[^belgium_95]. Licensing a work under a copyleft restriction
will in principle not constitute an abuse of right, considering that the
author, in general, will be able to prove a legitimate moral or tangible
interest. A legitimate moral interest could be wanting to keep his work
within the FOSS community, also in a derivative format. Companies which
have constructed a business model around distributing software under
copyleft restrictions will usually be able to prove a legitimate
interest.

However, if an author were to define the license conditions by saying
that the copyleft principle is not only reflected in what is considered
a derivative work in copyright terms, but also in other works, this
could be considered as an abuse of rights in certain cases[^belgium_96]. This
could be the case for instance if a license were to lay down that work
which has been stored on the same carrier as the licensed work needs to
be distributed under a FOSS license[^belgium_97].

The Software Act specifies: *The first sale in the European Union of a
copy of a program by the copyright owner or with his consent results in
the exhaustion of the right to control the distribution of that copy in
the European Union, with the exception of the right to control the
further leasing and lending out of the program or a copy thereof.*[^belgium_98]
The right of the author to further control the transfer of a specific
tangible copy which has been lawfully released in the European market is
therefore exhausted. Nevertheless this does not affect the right of the
author to lay down certain conditions regarding the use of the copy, or
a certain destination regarding that copy[^belgium_99]. After all, the free
transfer and further distribution also needs to transfer the conditions
of the license. The copyleft principle is therefore not, in principle,
in contrary to this principle.

### Damages

Damage caused by copyright violations are compensated under Belgian law
in accordance with the general applicable principles of the unlawful
act[^belgium_100]. This implies that the injured party of a copyright breach
needs to be compensated *en manière telle que la personne lésée se
retrouve dans la situation qui aurait été la sienne si la faute dont
elle se plaint n’avait pas été commise*[^belgium_101] Dual damages, triple
damages or other forms of punitive damages are not awarded under Belgian
law. Nor are costs reimbursed which the author spent on tracing and
prosecuting infringements[^belgium_102].

Infringements of software copyrights follow the same regime as
infringements of every other copyright[^belgium_103]. The aforementioned
principle is therefore applicable in case of copyright infringements of
software.

Infringements of software distributed under a FOSS license, do not need
to be sanctioned any differently than infringements of proprietary
software. After all, FOSS does not belong to the public domain. In no
way whatsoever has the author given up his rights.

Certain legal theory[^belgium_104] and case law[^belgium_105] assume that the damage to
the copyright owner will be limited, as the author has made his work
freely available via the internet. This argument does not always apply.

Besides establishing a reputation and recognition with the related value
creation, an author can have other reasons to make his work ‘freely’
available[^belgium_106]. The author may also have a direct monetary advantage
from the free distribution of his work. The simplest way is circulating
the free works with advertising. Another way is granting specific
services relating to the work. The free circulation of the work ensures
the work has many users. The author generates his income from the
provision of support and consulting services, or licensing “proprietary
add-ons[^belgium_107]”. Another business model is the so-called dual licensing
model[^belgium_108]. This model uses — as the name allows us to deduce- two
different licenses. The first license is often a copyleft license. This
first — free — license ensures the work is circulated quickly and has a
wide range of users. A second license without the copyleft system can
then be obtained against payment by interested parties who want to use
the work without their own additions being affected by the copyleft

    shall not be required where reproduction of the code and translation
    of its form within the meaning of article 5, a) and b) are
    indispensable to obtain the information necessary to achieve the
    interoperability of an independently created computer program with
    other programs, provided that the following conditions are met: a)
    the reproduction or translation is performed by a person having a
    right to use a copy of the program, or on his behalf by a person

    goal other than to achieve the interoperability of the independently
    created computer program; b) to be given to third parties, except

    provisions of this article may not be interpreted in such a way as
    to allow its application to be used in a manner which unreasonably
    prejudices to rightholders legitimate intrests or conflicts with a
    normal exploitation of the computer program.* See also Dévelopements

[^belgium_81]: Nor the principles (freedoms) of the Free Software movement, nor
    the Open Source Definition mandate the copyleft clause. Several FOSS
    licenses don’t contain a copyleft clause. Examples hereof are the
    Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) license and the Apache license.

[^belgium_82]: E.g., GPL version 3 Art. 5 stipulates: *You must license the
    entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into
    possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with
    any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work,
    and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License
    gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it
    does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received
    it.* GPL version 2 Art. 2 b stipulates: *You must cause any work
    that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or
    is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a
    whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
    License*.

[^belgium_104]: J., TRIAILLE e.g. states that the author of FOSS in case of
    infringement can’t claim royaliteis, as he gave up his right to
    royalties by distributing his work under a FOSS license on the
    internet. See J., TRIAILLE, “Licences ‘\`Open Source” et contrats
    avec les auteurs et les distributeurs’', 2005, p. 58-59.

[^belgium_105]: In like manner with pictures published on the internet under a
