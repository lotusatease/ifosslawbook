### Body of law

In Portugal, software is protected by copyright under the Software
Act[^portugal_1], which implements the Software Directive.[^portugal_2] Unlike the
majority of European Member States, the Portuguese legislator chose to
implement the Software Directive through a separate legislative measure,
instead of incorporating it into the Portuguese Copyright Act
(hereinafter, the “PCA”).[^portugal_3]

According to the preamble of the Software Act, the reason for using this
legislative technique is the difference between the core concepts of
software protection and common copyright protection for other types of
works.[^portugal_4] This does not mean, however, that provisions of the PCA will
not apply to software — being the general law in the field of copyright,
the PCA will be fully applicable where the Software Act does not provide
otherwise. Still, since the Software Act is lex specialis vis-à-vis the
PCA, it shall prevail where its provisions are different from the PCA,
even if the application of the latter is not expressly set aside.

It has been noted by several commentators that the Software Act deviates
significantly from the Software Directive it seeks to implement.[^portugal_5] The
following sections will analyze the specific relevant provisions of the
Software Act, while pointing out its disparities in relation to the
Software Directive.

### Object of protection

According to Article 1(2) of the Software Act, computer programs[^portugal_6]
that are creative will receive analogous protection to the one granted
to literary works. Differently from the Software Directive, computer
programs are not protected as literary works, but rather they are
granted an analogous protection.

The Software Act also departs from the Software Directive in relation to
the creativity requirement. The Directive mandates that a computer
program be protected if it is “original in the sense that it is the
author’s own intellectual creation.” Some authors have held that
creativity and originality are not substantially different for purposes
of a computer program qualifying for copyright protection.[^portugal_7] In any
case, given the principle of harmonious interpretation, which requires
national law to be interpreted in light of directives, it seems that in
practice the semantic differences will not be relevant.[^portugal_8]

The requirement is in line with the general provisions of the PCA, and
in particular with its Article 1(1), which defines a work as an
intellectual creation — and therefore as an expression of
creativity.[^portugal_9] Neither the Software Act nor the PCA, however, define
the concepts of “intellectual creation” or “creativity.” Legal doctrine,
on the other hand, highlights that an assessment of “creativity” does
not imply a judgment of merit of the work.[^portugal_10] Rather, the creativity
requirement is linked to the author’s individuality or personality.[^portugal_11]
It follows that the author must have creative choices; if there is only
one or few ways of expression of a computer program due to technical
constraints (e.g., programming language), the protection threshold will
not be met.[^portugal_12]

### Authors/Beneficiaries

Article 3(1) of the Software Act establishes that the general rules on
copyright authorship and ownership (Articles 11 to 26 of the PCA) apply
to computer programs. These are, e.g., the prohibition of formalities as
a requirement for protection (Article 12 of the PCA); the ownership of
copyright in case of subsidized works (Article 13 of the PCA); or the
definition and regime of joint works (Articles 16-18 of the PCA),
collective works (Articles 16 and 19 PCA), and composite works (Article
20 of the PCA).

Nevertheless, the following paragraphs of the provision set forth
specific rules for computer programs.

Firstly, the computer program created within a company shall be deemed
to be a collective work.[^portugal_13] Following the rules of the PCA, the rights
are thus vested in the person (natural or legal) who organized and
managed the process of creating the computer program.[^portugal_14] Such person
will be the one under whose name the program is released. However, if it
is possible to identify separately the personal input of any
collaborator, the regime of joint works shall apply to that specific
part. As a result, according to Article 18 of the PCA, the individual
author of that part is entitled to exercise his rights in relation to
his particular work.

It is in addition noteworthy that this qualification is a rebuttable
legal presumption. Therefore, it is possible that some computer programs
are considered to be joint works — namely, if they are divulged or
published under the name of some or all of its creators.[^portugal_15] Should
that be the case, the rights to the program will belong to all
co-authors jointly and will be regulated by rules on co-ownership as
provided by the Civil Code.[^portugal_16] It follows therefrom that the rights to
the computer program can be exercised by either of its co-authors, so
long as the program is used for its intended purposes and the other
co-authors are not prevented from exercising their rights too.[^portugal_17]
Still, despite this common exercise of rights, each individual author is
entitled to exercise his rights to his part of the program, if his
creative input is identifiable.[^portugal_18]

Moreover, the computer program can also be considered a derivative or a
composite work. The former results from a transformation (e.g.,
arrangement or translation) of a pre-existing work,[^portugal_19] while the
latter incorporates the whole or part of a pre-existing work.[^portugal_20] Both
require an authorization from the copyright owner of the previous work,
but do not involve his participation or collaboration.[^portugal_21]
Consequently, the author of the composite or derivative work is the
holder of the rights alone, without prejudice, however, to the rights of
the copyright owner in the pre-existing work.[^portugal_22]

Secondly, the general rules on works created by employees and
commissioned works (Article 14 (1)-(3) of the PCA) do not apply to
software. Such rules grant ownership in those works in accordance with
what was contractually agreed between the parties. In the absence of a
contract, the individual creator is deemed to be the author, unless his
name is not mentioned in the work (in which case copyright belongs to
the employer or to the client who commissioned the work).

By contrast, the Software Act establishes that the rights will be
granted to the employer or the client who commissioned the work, unless
(i) the employment contract provides otherwise or (ii) the purpose of
the contract is in contradiction with such solution.[^portugal_23] The law does
not clarify, however, whether the employer or client is the original
owner of the rights or whether he is an assignee.

### Economic rights

Articles 5 and 8 of the Software Act bestow upon the right holder three
exclusive economic rights. The first is the permanent or temporary
reproduction of the computer program, by any means or in any form, in
whole or in part. Secondly, the right holder has the right of alteration
of the program and reproduction of the results thereof,[^portugal_24] without
prejudice to the rights of the person who alters the program. Thirdly,
the Software Act grants the right of distribution of the program (or its
copies) to the right holder, which includes rental. However, following
Article 8(2) of the Software Act, the right of distribution has its
scope limited by the rule of exhaustion in what sale is concerned.

In addition to these exclusive rights, the original individual creator
might be entitled to a special remuneration right if the following
conditions are met: (i) the program far exceeds the function or job for
which he was engaged; (ii) the computer program was put to other uses or
generated benefits that were not included nor foreseen when the payment
was agreed.[^portugal_25]

Finally, according to Article 49 of the PCA — applicable to software via
Article 11(2) of the Software Act — the original individual creator
might also be entitled to a supplementary compensation where he assigned
or encumbered his economic rights against payment. This compensation is
due if the creator has undergone severe economic damages derived from
the disproportionality between that payment and the profit made by the
exploiter. This right, however, lasts only for two years counting from
when the creator became aware of the existence of damages.

### Exceptions to Exclusive Rights

Unlike the Software Directive, the Software Act does not devise
exceptions only. Instead, the Portuguese legislator granted certain
rights to the lawful user, which correspond to the exceptions in Article
5 of the Software Directive. The different terminology can in theory
have some implications — namely, while rights can be interpreted
broadly, exceptions must be narrowly construed. Hence, it is possible
that these “rights” of the lawful user are in practice broader than the
corresponding exceptions put forth by the Software Directive.

Article 6 of the Software Act allows the lawful user to make a back-up
copy (paragraph 1 (a)); to observe, study or test the functioning of the
program in order to determine the ideas and principles that underlie any
element of the program if he does so while performing any of the acts of
loading, displaying, running, transmitting or storing the program
(paragraph 1 (b)); and to load, display, run, transmit or store the
program, in order to use it or for purposes of error correction
(paragraph 2).

Out of these rights, only the last one can be overridden by
contract — any contractual provisions contrary to the first two rights
shall be null and void.[^portugal_26]

The Software Act further implemented the decompilation exception in more
or less the same terms as the Software Directive.[^portugal_27] However, while
the Directive prescribes as null and void contractual clauses contrary
to the whole provision, the Software Act only makes mandatory the rules
on access to information. The rules on the use of the information
obtained — e.g., use for purposes other than interoperability — can be
overridden by contract.

Deviating further from the Software Directive, the Software Act extended
the general copyright exceptions to the regime of computer programs,
save for the private copy exception.[^portugal_28] Article 75 of the PCA is the
main provision that regulates copyright exceptions and, following the
implementation of the Information Society Directive, establishes 19
exceptions to the exclusive rights. Article 10 of the Software Act
clarifies that such exceptions are only applicable if compatible with
computer programs, but the provision might still have the effect of
granting a higher number of exceptions than those allowed by the
Directive.

Moreover, Article 10(2) puts forth another exception that was also not
part of the Software Directive: the free analysis of computer programs
as objects of scientific research and teaching. This differs from
Article 6(1)(a), which links the observation, studying or testing to the
functioning of the program in order to determine its ideas or
principles — probably, e.g., to improve the performance of that
particular program. Article 10(2), on the other hand, has a more general
nature, in that its aims are scientific research and teaching.[^portugal_29]

### Moral Rights

The Software Act does not expressly mention moral rights. Still, Article
9 grants to the “original right holder” the right to be named as the
author of the program and the right to claim authorship over it, which
comes down to the moral right of paternity.[^portugal_30] Here, the term
“original right holder” should be taken to mean the individual creator
and not a legal person - it is commonly accepted that Portuguese law
only allows natural persons to hold moral rights.[^portugal_31]

The PCA establishes more moral rights in favor of the right
holder — namely, the integrity right and the right of withdrawal.[^portugal_32]
The question of whether the moral rights established in the PCA were
also applicable in the context of computer programs was the subject of
some controversy.[^portugal_33] This question was somehow settled in late 2012 by
the Portuguese Supreme Court, which ruled that the author of a computer
program has “minimum moral rights, being entitled not only to the right
of paternity, but also to the right of integrity.”[^portugal_34] The right of
integrity was at the center of the case, but it can be argued that the
Court’s ruling might be extended to also include the right of withdrawal
in the “minimum moral rights” granted to the author of a computer
program.

Moreover, the regime of moral rights as established by the PCA should be
applicable to these moral rights admitted in the context of the Software
Act. Thus, the moral rights of the author of a computer program are
unwaivable and inalienable.[^portugal_35]

### Term of protection

As a result of the Council Directive 93/98/EEC, harmonizing the term of
protection of copyright and certain related rights, the same term
applies for computer programs and other works of authorship. The
duration of protection will thus last until 70 years after the death of
the author.[^portugal_36] If however the rights are originally granted to someone
other than the intellectual creator (i.e., the natural person who
created the program), the duration is counted from the date when the
program was first lawfully published or divulged.[^portugal_37]

### Copyright contracts

Apart from the rules on ownership of programs created by employees or
contractors — which, as seen above, might be considered to establish
either original ownership or assignment in favor of a company, Article
11 of the Software Act lays down the contractual regime applicable to
computer programs.

Paragraph 1 of the provision mandates the application of the general
regime of contracts and in particular of the norms relating to the
specific contract at stake, or the most similar one, i.e. that which
presents the greatest degree of analogy.[^portugal_38] This refers back to the
Civil Code, but also to the Electronic Commerce Act,[^portugal_39] which
regulates electronic contracts, with an emphasis on consumer related
provisions.[^portugal_40] It is here important to note the general connection
between the PCA and the Civil Code, as set forth in Article 1303(2) of
the Civil Code.[^portugal_41] According to this provision, the rules of the Civil
Code apply in the alternative to intellectual property rights (including
copyright), when they are coherent therewith and do not contradict
special rules set forth in relation thereto.[^portugal_42] In any case, the
mention of typified contracts and analogy means that civil rules and
legal theories applying thereto prevail over those applying to atypical
contracts, requiring a case by case assessment of potential analogies to
regulated contracts (e.g. sale and purchase, donation, lease, etc.) and
its careful application by the interpreter.[^portugal_43]

Paragraph 2 of Article 11 establishes that certain provisions of the PCA
are applicable to computer programs.[^portugal_44] These concern, inter alia, the
norms on usufruct and pledge of copyright,[^portugal_45] and the assignment of
rights in future works (which is only valid for works created within the
following 10 years).[^portugal_46]

The reference to particular norms of the PCA on copyright contracts
leads to the conclusion that the other norms not referred to are not
applicable to software contracts.[^portugal_47] Significantly, it is the case of
Articles 43 and 44 of the PCA, which regulate the formalities inherent
to assignments of copyright. Because of the lack of reference to these
provisions, then, it seems that assignments of rights in software are
not subject to the same formal requirements as any other type of
copyright assignments (written contract with signatures recognized by a
notary public in the case of partial assignment, and public deed in the
case of total assignment).[^portugal_48]

The same goes for the formalities applicable to licensing. According to
Article 41 of the PCA, copyright licenses must take the form of a
written agreement and must contain certain elements, such as the
authorized form of use, geographical scope and price. Since Article 41
of the PCA is not part of the provisions that the Software Act refers
to, these formalities would not be applicable to software licensing
either.

Finally, Article 11(3) stipulates that software contracts must be
interpreted in accordance with the principle of good faith and their
ambit construed according to their purpose.[^portugal_49]

All in all, Article 11 combines different legal sources to form the
legal regime of software contracts. This might bring about some legal
uncertainty for purposes of identifying the nature of a given software
contract, and the regime thereby applicable to that specific situation.
In any case, it should be kept in mind that, in the context of contract
law, the rule is the contractual freedom of the parties.[^portugal_50] Therefore,
parties can choose the legal regime that better suits their needs,
provided that no mandatory rules are infringed.[^portugal_51]

In this context, it should be emphasized that the Software Act does not
establish a legal regime for the formation, formal requirements and
effects of software licensing agreements.[^portugal_52] Such regime must
therefore be found by articulating the rules explained above.

There is some controversy about whether the specific rules on typified
contracts apply to software agreements.[^portugal_53] Some authors resort to a
purpose bound interpretation of software agreements to identify
parallels between these agreements and typified contracts — such as
lease — thus rejecting the qualification of those as atypical.[^portugal_54]
Consequently, the rules of the identified typical contract would apply
directly to the software agreement, in combination with rules for
typified copyright contracts (e.g. publishing); an example would be the
application of the rules of lease (in the Civil Code) and those of
publishing agreements (in the PCA) to OEM software deals that involve
the production and distribution of software.[^portugal_55] Conversely, other
authors focus on the immaterial nature of software works, rejecting the
direct applicability of rules on contracts that regulate the use and
exploitation of material goods. This position would lead to the
application of rules from typified contracts only through analogy,
meaning that matters of formation, formal requirements and efficacy
could only be regulated by general rules on juridical relations as
applied to contracts, implying a greater degree of flexibility.[^portugal_56] We
are of the opinion the latter interpretation is more coherent when
confronting the legal regime with contractual practices on software,
most notably end-user license agreements concluded online.

In fact, online software license agreements are an instance of
electronic distance contracts, meaning that they may call upon the
application not only of the rules mentioned above (such as the Software
Act, the PCA, the Civil Code and the Electronic Commerce Act), but also
rules on distance contracts (in the Distance Contracts Act[^portugal_57]), and
standardized agreements (in the Standardized Terms in Contracts Act or
“STCA”[^portugal_58]), which are particularly protective of consumers and
translate into additional restrictions to freedom of contract.

This complexity is notorious considering that most end-user software
licenses are in fact standard contracts, where there is no possibility
for users to negotiate particular clauses. Such standard contracts are
entered into by the user following the signing of the terms and
conditions, by opening the packaging, by clicking or selecting an “I
agree” button, or by any other action whereby acceptance can be assumed.
That being the case, the STCA applies.

The STCA states a general principle of prohibition of clauses contrary
to principles of good faith.[^portugal_59] Moreover, it forbids the use of
certain clauses in standardized B2B contracts[^portugal_60] and in standardized
B2C contracts.[^portugal_61] Two types of open lists are put forth in each
context: absolutely forbidden and relatively forbidden clauses (also
called, respectively, “black list” and “grey list”).[^portugal_62] Both types of
clauses are considered to be null and void; the difference between them
is that the qualification as a relatively forbidden clause depends on a
case-by-case assessment, taking into account the specific features of
the contract at stake.

In relation to standardized B2B contracts, some relevant examples of
absolutely forbidden clauses include: exclusion of liability for
non-contractual damages;[^portugal_63] exclusion of defaulting liability for
intentional misconduct or gross negligence;[^portugal_64] attribution of the
exclusive right to interpret any clause of the contract to its
drafter;[^portugal_65] or exclusion of compensation, when admitted by law.[^portugal_66]
On the other hand, still in the context of B2B contracts, the following
are examples of relatively forbidden clauses: establishment of
excessively long deadlines for acceptance and rejection of proposals in
favor of the drafter;[^portugal_67] establishment of said deadlines for
compliance with contractual obligations;[^portugal_68] or clauses mandating
disproportionate criminal sanctions.[^portugal_69]

With regard to standardized B2C contracts, Article 21 prescribes as
absolutely forbidden clauses, e.g., the unilateral alteration of
obligations;[^portugal_70] the unilateral verification and establishment of the
quality of goods and services supplied;[^portugal_71] or the vouching for the
parties' legal or factual knowledge in relation to the contract.[^portugal_72]
Article 22 focuses on the relatively forbidden clauses in B2C contracts,
namely: the excessively long duration of contract;[^portugal_73] the free
termination of contract;[^portugal_74] the unjustified prohibition of repairs or
supply by third parties;[^portugal_75] or the demand of formalities not
prescribed by law.[^portugal_76]

In the context of software contracts, the type of clauses deemed null
and void by the STCA can thus effectively curtail some choices of the
right holder when entering into a contract with potential licensees or
assignees.

### Enforcement

Enforcement of copyright in Portugal is regulated by Articles 195 to
211-B of the PCA, which have inter alia implemented the Enforcement
Directive[^portugal_77] and provide for a broad range of criminal provisions,
preliminary administrative measures and civil actions. Criminal and
civil liability are independent and can be exercised simultaneously,
either in separate actions or jointly in a criminal procedure.[^portugal_78]

Preliminary administrative measures can be requested by the author to
police and administrative authorities with jurisdiction over the place
of occurrence of the unauthorized use; they amount to a request that the
authority causes such use to cease and, in accumulation, apprehends the
totality of the revenue from such unauthorized uses.[^portugal_79]

Civil actions include: (i) rights of prior communications, information
and supervision[^portugal_80]; (ii) specific evidence gathering and preservation
measures[^portugal_81]; (iii) provisional and preliminary injunctions (which
include both copyright specific measures and those available under the
general civil procedure law)[^portugal_82]: and (iv) measures to redress
infringement, including a broad right to information regarding the
infringing activity, the application of corrective and inhibitory
measures post-infringement and the establishment of specific criteria
for damages (the latter aspect is addressed in greater detail below in
the “Damages” section.[^portugal_83] / [^portugal_84]). The possibility of application of
some of these measures or their application above a certain threshold is
limited to infringing acts occurring on a commercial scale.[^portugal_85]

Preliminary administrative measures and civil actions (ii) through (iv)
above seem to apply to software as a copyright protected subject
matter.[^portugal_86] This is coherent with the Software Act’s specific provision
on the seizure of counterfeit software copies.[^portugal_87] Under this
provision, the seizure follows the general regime applicable to seizure
of counterfeit works, being also possible to seize any devices in
commerce the sole intended purpose of which is to facilitate the
unauthorized removal or circumvention of any technical safeguard which
may have been applied to protect a computer program.[^portugal_88]

Procedural legitimacy for taking action belongs to the copyright holder
and, where collective rights management applies, to collecting
societies.[^portugal_89] In Portugal, the only collecting society representing
software rights holders is ASSOFT - Associação Portuguesa de
Software.[^portugal_90] Importantly, the position of exclusive or non-exclusive
licensees of an infringed work is not addressed in the law; however, it
is possible to interpret some provisions as allowing a licensee that can
prove he/she is entitled to use the work (e.g. by presenting the license
agreement in a judicial action) to benefit from said measures.[^portugal_91] In
any event, nothing seems to prevent that a third party — such as a
fiduciary — is authorized by the rights holder to take action on his/her
behalf, as Portuguese law does not expressly forbid fiduciary
transmission of rights (e.g. to a collecting society), although some
legal scholarship believes it to be invalid.[^portugal_92]

The above considerations apply to actions based on economic exclusive
rights; they do not apply regarding any claims for breach of moral
rights, for which only authors (or their successors) have
legitimacy.[^portugal_93]

In what regards criminal law, the Software Act states that software is
protected against unlawful reproduction and makes an express reference
to Law 109/91, of 17 August[^portugal_94], which has been replaced by the new
Cybercrime Act.[^portugal_95] The articulation of the relevant legal instruments
suggests that the Cybercrime Act should be qualified as lex specialis
regarding the PCA and its criminal sanctions for copyright
infringement.[^portugal_96] That being the case, the Cybercrime Act limits the
criminal sanctions for software infringement to acts of unlawful
reproduction, dissemination and communication to the public of a
computer program (presumably including any derivatives), providing jail
sentences up to three years and/or equivalent fines.[^portugal_97] The attempted
form of the unlawful acts is punishable, as are acts carried out by
legal persons.[^portugal_98] Additionally, the court may rule as lost in favor of
the state any objects, materials, equipment or devices used and owned by
the author of the crimes.[^portugal_99]

## Unprotected software and public domain software

As explained above, only software that is original in the sense that it
is the author’s own intellectual creation — or in the Software Act’s
formulation, has “creative character” — benefits from protection
analogous to copyright.[^portugal_100]

Non-original software does not come into consideration for copyright
protection and can, in principle, be used freely from copyright
exclusive rights.[^portugal_101] However, the functional nature of most software
dictates that the threshold of creativity required for protection is
relatively low, meaning in practice that most software that is not a
copy from another computer program and bears a minimum trait of
connection to its author will in principle be afforded legal protection.

Under Portuguese law, there are no software subject matter specific
public domain rules. Instead, the general rules in the PCA apply,
meaning that public domain is limited to works for which the copyright
term has expired.[^portugal_102]

Public domain software — if any exists — can be used, reproduced or
executed freely without permission or the payment of a fee. It can in
certain cases even be presented by third parties as their own
work[^portugal_103], and by modifying the original work, third parties can take
certain versions of said software out of the public domain.

## Analysis of FOSS under Portuguese Law

From a conceptual and legal perspective, FOSS is identical to other
types of software, and benefits from similar protection. Portuguese
copyright law fully supports the rights of the copyright holder to
stipulate terms and conditions in a software license, having the
exclusive right to exercise or authorize the use of the rights of
reproduction, transformation, distribution, and communication to the
public/making available. Therefore, absent public policy prohibitions, a
rights holder is entitled to select the conditions under which he/she
licenses software to third parties, such as via a FOSS license.

Under Portuguese law, FOSS should be considered as software to which
users generally have more rights of use than under a proprietary or
“non-free” software license. This is so due to the breadth and scope of
the underlying FOSS license agreement. As such, and assuming the
validity of a FOSS license, its terms and conditions must be respected
by the user-licensee.

That being said, it is important to note that FOSS licenses deviate
significantly from conventional license agreements. Such deviation
raises issues as to the application thereto of specific qualifications
that may be valid for other software agreements. To compound on the
problem, and as noted above, the wording of the Software Act has led to
extensive debate in Portugal as to the different possible legal
qualifications of software agreements.[^portugal_104] In the balance of this
debate, we believe that FOSS licenses should be considered as sui
generis or atypical license agreements, even if they are still based on
similar mechanisms to those of license contracts in general, and of
end-user software license agreements in particular.

### Copyrights

Although FOSS can be written and owned by one person or be owned by one
legal entity[^portugal_105], generally speaking, after some time the software is
the result of the work of several authors who can make claims to it.

The crucial question is whether later additions create a joint
work — i.e. a work created by collaborating authors giving rise to
co-authorship configurations, or whether the original software is the
end work and every contribution created during the further development
of the software is to be deemed a composite or derivative work.[^portugal_106]
The legal consequences are different at both authorship and ownership
levels.[^portugal_107]

#### Qualification of FOSS

For FOSS to be qualified as a joint work of co-authors it is not
necessary for every co-author to have contributed equally, nor are
co-authors required to work on it simultaneously; however, it is
necessary that each contributor intervenes during the creative process
and that the contribution is worthy of copyright protection.[^portugal_108] The
provider of an idea is not a co-author[^portugal_109], nor is the person who
corrects a technical error or merely follows instructions.[^portugal_110]

Whereas the first version of the software, if written by several people,
can in many cases be qualified either as a collective work (when created
in the context of a company) or as a joint work, this seems much less
the case for the later versions, which are based on the original work,
without however there being any “consultation” between the
authors.[^portugal_111] These later versions will be qualified as composite or
derivative works,[^portugal_112] or possibly (although less likely) collective
works, if the individual or entity author/editor of the new version
collated or organized and directed a series of different programs to
form a distinct new software based on the original. Therefore, in terms
of the legal consequences, a distinction needs to be made between the
rights of the original owner, the original co-authors and the rights of
people or entities who carry out work based on the original work.

#### Rights of the original co-authors

The general authorship and ownership rules of the PCA apply to the
creation/production of software.[^portugal_113] However, if a software work is
made in the context of a company, there is a legal presumption that the
software is a collective work.[^portugal_114] Collective works are regulated in
Articles 16-19 of the PCA. The law defines collective works as those
organized by initiative of an individual or collective entity and that
are divulged or published in said entity’s name.[^portugal_115] The copyright of
a collective work is granted to the entity that has organized and
directed its creation and in the name of which it has been divulged or
published.[^portugal_116]

The full application of the collective works regime presupposes that the
individual contribution of every author in the software work cannot be
discerned or clearly distinguished, i.e. that the work is
“indivisible”.[^portugal_117] If however it is possible to make a distinction of
individual contribution(s) within the collective work, then the law
foresees the application of a different legal regime to that
contribution(s), namely the regime of joint works.[^portugal_118]

A distinction then must be made between two potentially applicable legal
regimes. First, if a FOSS work is made in the context of a company and
individual contributions cannot be distinguished, the rules on
collective works apply. Likewise if the FOSS work is created by an
employee in the performance of his professional functions or as a result
of instructions of the employer, unless the employment contract (i)
states otherwise or (ii) is silent and the purposes of the contract lead
to a different conclusion.[^portugal_119]

Most FOSS works will likely not be made in the context of a company,
meaning that the legal presumption of application of the collective work
provisions will not operate. This leads to the second possibility, where
the FOSS work is deemed a joint work, which the law defines as the work
divulged or published in the name of all the collaborators (co-authors)
or some of them, whether or not individual contributions can be
distinguished.[^portugal_120]

In sum, severable contributions both in collective works and joint works
are subject to the same rules.[^portugal_121] Indivisible contributions follow
different regimes, specific to the type of work: for collective works
the rights of the contributors in their indivisible contribution are
vested in the individual or entity that is presumed to own the work; for
joint works, the legal regime is different and allows for a degree of
contractual freedom among co-authors.

The legal regime for joint works can be summarized as follows. First,
the copyright ownership of the work, in its unity, belongs to all
co-authors and is regulated pursuant to the rules on co-ownership for
the common exercise of the rights in that work, as set forth in the
Civil Code.[^portugal_122] Consequently, for indivisible works, each of the
co-authors must be authorized by the other in order to exercise his/her
copyright separately; in other words, joint exercise is mandated as
general rule.[^portugal_123] However, if no agreement is reached, then it will be
possible for any of the co-authors to use the joint work, as long as
he/she does so for the purposes for which the work was created and does
not exclude the remaining co-authors from its use.[^portugal_124] Moreover,
exercise of copyright over the indivisible joint work is possible
pursuant to decisions taken by simple majority of the co-authors.[^portugal_125]

Second, the specific value of each contribution may be freely stipulated
amongst the co-authors; if it is not agreed to in writing, then all
contributions are deemed to be of identical value.[^portugal_126] As mentioned
above, those individuals that merely provide assistance to authors in
the production and divulgation of the work are not deemed co-authors
and, for that reason, do not participate in the copyright on the joint
work.[^portugal_127]

Third, it is possible that a joint work is divulged or published solely
in the name of one or a few of the collaborators, in which case a legal
presumption operates: if there is no specific designation of the
remaining co-authors in any part of the work, the law assumes that the
non-designated collaborators have assigned their rights to the named
co-authors.[^portugal_128]

Portuguese law provides for two exceptions to this general regime,
applying to severable contributions of individual co-authors (or, by
reference, to homologous contributors to collective works).[^portugal_129] On the
one hand, any contributor can request the divulgation, publication,
exploitation or modification of the joint work; in case of dispute, the
matter must be settled under rules of good faith.[^portugal_130] That is a
deviation from the simple majority rule applicable to indivisible
works.[^portugal_131] On the other hand and in addition, any contributor can,
without prejudice to the joint exploitation of the overall work,
individually exercise the rights pertaining to his identifiable
contribution.[^portugal_132]

On balance, the default legal regime described above, together with the
principle of freedom of contract, seem sufficiently compatible with
overall authorship and ownership stipulations in typical FOSS licenses.
What such regime does not allow and the general Portuguese regime does
not permit are agreements that constitute waivers to moral rights, as
discussed in greater detail below.[^portugal_133]

#### Authors of derivative or composite works

After some time FOSS will, in most cases, be a composite or derivative
work.[^portugal_134] Composite works are those that incorporate, in the whole or
in part, a pre-existing work, while derivative works are those that
imply a transformation of a pre-existing work; in both instances, the
incorporation or transformation would be done with the authorization but
without the collaboration or “consultation” of the rights holder of the
underlying work.[^portugal_135] The last aspect distinguishes composite or
derivative works from joint works.

The authors of the composite or derivative work are the only persons
with a copyright on their work.[^portugal_136] This is an independent and full
copyright, which is restricted insofar as the composite or derivative
work cannot be operated without the consent of the owner of the
copyright on the original or pre-existing work.[^portugal_137] For typical FOSS
licenses, this consent should theoretically not pose a problem as it is
included in the license; this, of course, subject to the compliance with
the terms and conditions of said license (e.g. regarding further
distribution of the derivative work).[^portugal_138] In fact, such consent would
equate to an authorization for a specific use (incorporation, adaptation
or transformation), meaning that it would in principle not trigger the
application of the most problematic formal requirements applying to
assignments or transmissions of copyright under Portuguese law.[^portugal_139]
This contractual structure would also in principle allow authors in both
works to judicially enforce their respective copyrights.

#### Management of copyrights

With the purpose of controlling the chain of copyright ownership in a
more efficient manner, it may be useful to concentrate all copyrights
concerning a FOSS project within one organization, with the aim to
simplify the management and jointly enforce rights. The contractual
method underlying such concentration of rights is however a crucial
issue under Portuguese Law.

One of the possible methods is via a transfer or assignment, as
suggested for example by the Free Software Foundation Europe (“FSFE”),
which provides a Fiduciary License Agreement (“FLA”) for rights holders
to assign their rights to a fiduciary, preferably the FSFE itself.[^portugal_140]
In general terms, the fiduciary transfer means that the assignee shall
not act on his own name and behalf but on account of the assignors
(typically the original authors).

Such contractual arrangement does not correspond per se to an instance
of collective rights management, which is subject to specific
authorization and supervision requirements under Portuguese law.[^portugal_141]
Moreover, contrary to other countries,[^portugal_142] collective rights
management in Portugal is not so much based on a fiduciary transfer of
copyrights, but more on a licensing and representation mechanism.[^portugal_143]

Not being a case of (regulated) collective rights management, such
agreements would need to conform to the general rules on contractual
assignments of copyright applicable to software works, which are far
from uncontroversial under Portuguese Law.[^portugal_144]

In general, there are two possible interpretations of the legal rules of
assignment in this field, depending on how one articulates the relevant
provisions of the Software Act, the PCA and the Civil Code.

On the one hand, it is possible to argue that the Software Act contains
a special regime for contracts, whereby a particular agreement is
subject to the general rules on contracts in the Civil Code plus the
rules on typified contracts that present the greatest similarities to
the underlying deal, but excluding provisions of the PCA not expressly
mentioned by the Software Act in its Article 11(2).[^portugal_145] Among the
omitted provisions are those anachronistic PCA rules on partial and
total assignments, which impose severe formal requirements on copyright
assignments, under penalty of nullity.[^portugal_146] Under this interpretation,
an agreement such as the FLA would probably be valid vis-à-vis
Portuguese Law.

Alternatively, if it is considered that the PCA provisions on
assignments apply, it is difficult to defend the validity of a transfer
under the FLA, as it fails to comply with essential formal requirements;
this would entail the nullity of such agreements.[^portugal_147] However, if the
agreement in question contains provisions whereby an assignment is
converted into a broad grant of rights in countries where the first
contractual method is not legally admissible — as is the case with the
FLA[^portugal_148] --, then it is possible to argue in favor of the validity of
such agreement.

Given the lack of legal certainty as to requirements applying to
assignments and the formal requirements the PCA attaches thereto, it is
arguable that a concentration of rights in a single organization via
broad authorization of use contractual schemes constitutes a superior
solution to secure the validity and effectiveness of the method.

### Moral rights and FOSS

The US origin of FOSS is perhaps in no issue clearer than in its
treatment of moral rights, a subject to which it attaches comparatively
less importance than countries in civil law systems.[^portugal_149] In this
respect, the Open Source Definition specifies that the author of
software distributed under a FOSS license cannot oppose the use of the
software by certain people and groups or for certain areas of
application.[^portugal_150] The question then becomes what is the admissibility
of such provisions when they purport to constitute a waiver of moral
rights.

Here, again, Portuguese law is not clear. As mentioned before, the
Software Act does not expressly mention moral rights, but its Article 9
is usually interpreted as covering this topic.[^portugal_151] This provision
guarantees the original rights holder (understood in this Chapter as the
natural person) the right to be mentioned by name in the program and
that of claiming its authorship, being silent on the applicability of
other moral rights set forth in the PCA.[^portugal_152]

Also as mentioned above, some legal scholarship has interpreted this
provision as meaning, a contrario sensu, that no other moral rights are
granted to authors of software works.[^portugal_153] Such interpretation would
mean that an author of a FOSS work would not even have to proceed to a
global renouncement of the future exercise of moral rights (other than
mention of name and paternity), as he would not be deemed to have such
rights.

Even if this argumentation is solid, we note that it’s not unanimous,
with relevant legal scholarship defending that software authors have the
same moral rights as prescribed for most authors under the PCA, although
to a reduced degree, given the specific nature of software as a work of
authorship.[^portugal_154] That reduced degree is particularly important, as the
Software Act grants a broad right of transformation, the scope of which
limits to a significant extent that of the moral right of
integrity,[^portugal_155] and would probably accommodate most FOSS licensing
provisions enabling downstream derivative works. Such interpretation is
likely the most coherent with the aforementioned Portuguese Supreme
Court ruling of 2012 recognizing “minimum moral rights” to authors of
computer programs.[^portugal_156]

### Enforcing FOSS licenses

#### General Considerations

The question of whether a FOSS license can be enforced under the
Portuguese legal system depends on whether a valid license was issued.
For the assessment of such validity inquiry, two essential questions
must be answered: (i) who are the contracting parties, and (ii) has the
license been validly reached? We will answer these questions in turn
against the backdrop of our previous framing of the regime applicable to
software contracts under Portuguese law.[^portugal_157] Some preliminary remarks
are however required.

Copyright protection of software via exclusive rights implies that use
of protected works (such as FOSS) requires authorization by the
respective owners, except when such use is covered by an exception or
limitation. FOSS licenses are designed to provide such authorization, a
construct which is conceptually distinct from that of a copyright
assignment or transmission. As noted above, Article 11 of the Software
Act opens the door for the use of external contractual rules not only of
the PCA, but also of the Civil Code and a myriad of other legal
instruments.[^portugal_158]

The application of some of these rules impacts directly the discussion
on the validity of FOSS licenses. For example, as noted above, the PCA
contains general provisions on formal and content requirements of
copyright contracts.[^portugal_159] The validity of FOSS licenses is discussed in
greater detail below; however, it is important to note that, in what
concerns content requirements, the application of the general PCA rules
on copyright contracts to FOSS licenses would likely not be problematic,
as these licenses in principle meet such minimum requirements.[^portugal_160]

Moreover, in what regards qualification of FOSS licenses, these present
such a specific type of use regulation that the direct application
thereto of typified contracts (either in the PCA or Civil Code) seems a
conceptual stretch. The predominant non-commercial purpose of the
licensing aspect in such agreements (not only in terms of reproduction
but also in terms of distribution or conveyance), and the focus on
allowing transformations on the immaterial work that constitutes the
license object do not satisfactorily overlap with existing contractual
types.[^portugal_161] Thus, matters of validity and efficacy must be addressed
and evaluated in light of general rules — notably mutual consent and
freedom of form — applying to software agreements, as well as admissible
analogies to existing types.

Finally, part of the legal instruments and rules applying to agreements
such as FOSS licenses translate into obligations of information and
transparency to consumers prior to the conclusion of the contract,
together with safeguards of his/her position as the party with a weaker
bargaining position (i.e. the user-licensee). To that extent, taking
into consideration the nature and configuration of FOSS licenses, such
rules do not seem to challenge per se their validity. Insofar as these
rules may translate into imperative provisions in addition to the
legitimate user’s minimum rights in the Software Act, it is however
important to ascertain whether FOSS licenses conflict with them.

#### Contracting parties

The issue of who are the contracting parties in a FOSS licensing scheme
depends on its constitution. In the simplest formulation the answer is
clear: if an author makes his/her work available under a FOSS license,
the license is reached as between the author and the licensee. However,
if there are different co-authors, the issue becomes more complicated.
With whom the licensee concludes a contract depends then on the mutual
agreement between the co-authors.

In the majority of cases, a FOSS work will be the creative result of the
output of several authors, who developed it in separate and not in joint
consultation with each other. In fact, FOSS is typically realized via a
chain of authors who all contributed to the realization of the program.

Insofar as a new author makes an original contribution to the work
(i.e., with the “creative character” required by the Software Act), a
composite or (most likely) a derivative work is produced.

Given that both the rights to use (reproduction) and make derivatives
(transformation or adaption) fall within the purview of the author’s
exclusive rights, each potential licensee will require the consent of
every author in the chain who made an original contribution to the
eventual FOSS work, starting with the author of the first work. This
consent can be direct (i.e. to the next licensee in the chain), or
indirect by giving consent in the FOSS license to the next author to
modify and distribute the work to subsequent authors/contributors or
users.

The majority of FOSS licenses address this potential problem by
introducing “viral” provisions establishing a contractual bound between
the licensee and all authors in the chain of derivative works, in such a
way as to expressly cover the possibility of onward licensing of each
author’s contribution. This has certainly been true for the several
iterations of the GPL licenses, from version 1 to the current version
3[^portugal_162], Article 10 of which (on “Automatic Licensing of Downstream
Recipients”) reads, in the relevant part: “Each time you convey a
covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to
this License… You may not impose any further restrictions on the
exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.”[^portugal_163]

This provision builds upon and extends the homologous provisions in
previous versions. It allows each user of the FOSS work to obtain a
license from all authors in the chain. Insofar as this licensing chain
of (mostly) derivate works is configured as a chain of agreements for
specified uses of software works to which the respective authors have
consented to, it should be considered valid under Portuguese law.

#### Validity of the FOSS licenses

The choice of a FOSS license by an author is motivated by the desire to
distribute and make available his work to third parties, possibly
subject to certain use restrictions. In that sense, it is essential that
such restrictions be enforceable.

The valid formation of a contract under Portuguese Law generally
requires an offer and acceptance of the offer via a manifestation of
consent to be bound by the terms of the offer.[^portugal_164] Conventional IT
agreements are entered into by the explicit acceptance of the terms and
conditions by the licensee following the signing of the terms and
conditions, by opening the packaging, by clicking or selecting an “I
agree” button or by any other action from which acceptance can be
recognized. The latter examples are — similarly to FOSS
licenses — pre-formulated standard contracts.[^portugal_165] These methods to
reach a licensing agreement have been sufficiently tried and tested and,
at least between commercial parties, are generally considered to be
valid.[^portugal_166] FOSS licenses concluded in the same way will be valid.

Typically, in a FOSS environment, however, software is made available
with the simple specification on a website (e.g., “licensed under the
GPLv3 license”) or in the source code of the software that it concerns
FOSS.[^portugal_167] In such configurations, there is no requirement that the
license is explicitly accepted via an affirmative manifestation of
consent by the licensee. Having to click and confirm every time could in
some cases interfere with the use of the software. The Open Source
Definition opposes demanding explicit agreement with the license
conditions with the aim of confirming the agreement between licensor and
licensee.[^portugal_168] The main question that arises here is whether in these
cases a valid license is entered into.

The answer to this question is unclear. FOSS licenses are subject, inter
alia, to the rules on electronic contracts in the Electronic Commerce
Act.[^portugal_169] Although this legal instrument contains a legal fiction for
consent based on a need for consent plus a subsequent confirmation by
the licensee, this double consent in principle would not be required in
B2B or direct (meaning online) B2C (with immediate delivery), as is the
case with many FOSS licenses.[^portugal_170] That notwithstanding, the licensee’s
confirmation would be required, as would minimum information
requirements considering the applicable license. However, these legal
provisions must be applied in the context of a FOSS licensing
transaction, where the licensee is a user of a copyright protected work,
who therefore is required to indicate the grounds on which he/she is
able to use the work. Using the software without the author’s consent
entails copyright infringement. That implies that everyone who wants to
use software which they find via the internet has an obligation to
actively look for a license. If the user cannot prove he has a
license[^portugal_171], he must refrain from using it. The mere availability of a
software work on the internet does not mean it becomes public
domain[^portugal_172] and there is no Portuguese case law that sustains the
applicability of a doctrine of implied consent (free of FOSS terms and
conditions) in these cases.[^portugal_173]

As such, it is arguable that the unavailability of the applicable terms
and conditions may give rise to licensee challenges to the validity of
certain clauses or terms of the contract. A licensor could respond by
stating that even de minimis indications, coupled with the above
arguments would necessarily mean that specific FOSS licensing terms
apply to all such software he makes available (thus constituting the
required written contract). Accordingly, a disagreement with those terms
would mean a failure of the licensee to accept the applicable terms of
use, the consequence being that no license had been granted and any use
of the FOSS would be an infringement of copyright. Competent Portuguese
Courts would in all likelihood afford relevance to business practices in
the professional sector as to the conclusion of such contracts. To that
point, the Portuguese practice is similar to other European countries,
where it is common knowledge and practice of software developers that
FOSS licenses are made available to be read in the source code or on the
project website.[^portugal_174] In sum, in this professional context any
arguments that the FOSS terms were unknown or that the FOSS license did
not validly bind the parties are unlikely to succeed.[^portugal_175]

In any event, it seems doubtful that a user would benefit from disputing
the existence of a FOSS license, as that would imply the invalidity of
the copyright license and prevent him/her from using the FOSS.

Finally, the obligation to establish the existence of specific licensing
terms governing the transaction is also relevant if we consider specific
contractual rules in the PCA as directly applicable to FOSS agreements.
This is because copyright contracts under PCA are subject to a principle
of solemnity, meaning that they must be in written form.[^portugal_176] The
Portuguese Supreme Court and some legal scholarship qualify this
requirement as a formality ad probationem, directed at establishing the
existence of the agreement and proving it.[^portugal_177] This position is
controversial, as it is possible to instead qualify said requirement as
an ad substantiam formality (required for the validity of the agreement
itself), by focusing on the general default rule of the Civil Code that
any contractual declaration inconsistent with legally prescribed formal
requirements is null, unless stated otherwise.[^portugal_178] The adoption of
this argument would lead to the nullity of FOSS agreements where it is
impossible to establish the underlying licensing terms.

#### Breach of FOSS licenses

Infringement of FOSS licenses may give rise to separate claims, on the
basis of copyright infringement and breach of contract.[^portugal_179] A claim
for copyright infringement is justified solely when the violation
affects the exclusive rights of the author protected by copyright. This
may bring about both civil and criminal measures, with the first being
of significant scope post-implementation of the Enforcement
Directive.[^portugal_180] The breach of FOSS contractual clauses not based on the
exclusive rights of the author does not imply copyright infringement,
translating instead into breach of contract, regulated by the Civil
Code. Typical examples thereof are the non-payment of royalties,
insufficient exploitation of the work and the violation of
non-competition obligations. The rights holder is legally entitled to
take action in civil courts under both claims. In fact, from a
litigation practice standpoint, he/she would be advised to do so, due to
potential challenges on the validity of the FOSS license.

### Waiver and liability

Typically, FOSS licenses contain very strong exoneration clauses, which
discharge the author from all liability.[^portugal_181] One of the traditional
justifications of FOSS proponents for this is that FOSS is often made
available without a fee, as a result of which the author generates
insufficient income to pay for liability insurances and legal
costs.[^portugal_182] This argument, although uncontested vis-à-vis amateur
programmers, does not apply to the same extent in relation to
professional programmers who build their business model around FOSS. To
cover the eventuality of being held liable for applicable default legal
provisions, professional suppliers of FOSS or related services often
provide guarantees and technical support, a practice allowed by some
FOSS licensing terms.[^portugal_183] The main legal issue raised in this context
relates to the admissibility of such exoneration clauses under
Portuguese law.

#### General rules on exclusion and limitation of liability

Most clauses of this type are aimed at eliminating or restricting (e.g.,
by establishing a monetary ceiling) ex ante the Licensor’s obligation to
indemnify the licensee for damages caused by the licensed FOSS.

Under Portuguese law and in the context of contractual liability, any
clause whereby the creditor (here: the licensor) waives in advance any
of his legally established rights for instances of breach of contract or
delay by the debtor (here: the licensee), is null and void.[^portugal_184] This
is subject to one exception: such waivers or limitations are deemed
acceptable for damages resulting from acts of legal representatives and
auxiliary persons, so long as the exemption does not cover acts in
violation of duties imposed by norms of public order.[^portugal_185]

This general rule is supplemented by specific rules applying to
pre-formulated standard contracts, which not only prohibit general
clauses contrary to the principle of good faith, but also specific
exoneration clauses found in B2B and B2C agreements.[^portugal_186] These
specific rules prohibit clauses in standardized contracts that exclude
or limit (directly or indirectly) liability for: Damages to life, moral
or physical integrity, or health; Non-contractual economic damages
caused to the licensee or a third party; Damages resulting from
intentional (with “dolo”) or grossly negligent (with “culpa grave”)
non-performance, delay or defective performance; Damages resulting from
intentional or grossly negligent acts of legal representatives and
auxiliary persons.[^portugal_187]

In sum, it can be stated that most exemption or limitation clauses
present in FOSS licenses should be deemed null and void when they
purport to apply to intentional or grossly negligent acts; in addition,
specific clauses (e.g. applying to defective performance or acts of
legal representatives and auxiliary persons) may be valid only in cases
of minor negligence (“culpa leve”).[^portugal_188]

#### Specific rules for consumers, sellers and producers

In addition to the general regime explained above, stricter rules may
apply that completely forbid exoneration or limitation clauses, notably
when the licensor qualifies as a producer or professional seller in a
relationship with a consumer.[^portugal_189]

As a preliminary remark, it is important to note that many FOSS projects
should not be qualified as producers or professional sellers. Likewise,
a good number of licensees are developers and not consumers. Therefore,
the following considerations do not apply to either category of actors
in the FOSS licensing chain.

A further distinction must be made between the qualification of the
licensor as a “producer” or a “seller”. Under the Portuguese Sale of
Consumer Goods Act[^portugal_190], a “producer” is a manufacturer, EU importer or
any other entity that is identified as the producer of a consumer
good.[^portugal_191] It is disputable whether FOSS developers and distributers
can also be qualified as producers.[^portugal_192] Differently, a “seller” is the
individual or company that, under a contract, sells (leases or provides
related services to) consumer goods within his/her professional
activity.[^portugal_193] The Sale of Consumer Goods Act applies only to consumer
goods, defined as immovable goods and “movable tangible goods” (“bem
móvel corpóreo”).[^portugal_194]

If nonetheless one considers that licensed software qualifies as a
consumer good (and the underlying transaction is a “sale” or “lease”),
then the professional seller is deemed to know of any hidden defects in
the software that are manifested up until 2 years after its
“delivery”.[^portugal_195] As a consequence of such defects, the consumer is
entitled to the reparation/substitution of the good or termination of
the contract,[^portugal_196] in which case he/she is entitled to damages arising
from the supply of defective goods.[^portugal_197] Any exemption or limitation of
liability clause that affects consumer rights derived from hidden
defects known (or presumed to be known) by the seller at the time of the
sale is null and void.[^portugal_198]

Under such a fact pattern, the professional seller of FOSS would be
liable before the consumer under a presumption that the lack of
conformity existed as of the good’s delivery date, unless he/she could
demonstrate the lack of conformity to be incompatible with the nature of
the good or with the characteristics of the defect.[^portugal_199] Under the
general regime on the sale of goods (applicable to software and FOSS
only if one considers the analogy admissible), the seller would be
liable to repair or replace the software unless he/she could establish
lack of knowledge (without reasonable grounds for knowing) of the
defect.[^portugal_200] Failure to establish this “unintentional” lack of
knowledge entitles the licensee to termination of the agreement and
damages.[^portugal_201] In practice, the burden of proof of the seller in either
case will be difficult to meet.

Should the developers or distributors of FOSS be qualified as producers,
the Sale of Consumer Goods Act’s rules on direct liability of the
producer may apply.[^portugal_202] According to these, the consumer is always
entitled to claim from the producer the reparation or replacement of the
good, unless such claim is impossible or disproportionate taking into
consideration the value of the good, the nature of the defect and the
inconveniences caused to the consumer by the reparation or
replacement.[^portugal_203] Importantly, claims under this Act cannot be waived
or limited in advance; any agreements to the contrary are null and void.

Moreover, the Consumer Protection Act confers upon the consumer a right
to damages resulting from the supply of defective goods or
services,[^portugal_204] making the producer strictly liable for all damages
arising from defects in the goods he places on the market.[^portugal_205]
Similarly to the Sale of Consumer Goods Act, these consumer rights may
not be waived or limited in advance; any agreements to the contrary are
null and void.[^portugal_206]

Finally, the producer is also strictly liable under the Liability for
Defective Products Act[^portugal_207] for damages caused by his or hers unsafe
defective products.[^portugal_208] Only damages resulting in death and personal
injury, or those related to goods of the licensee destined to private
use are covered.[^portugal_209] The producer can only avoid liability by showing
the occurrence of specific circumstances, such as that he did not make
the product available.[^portugal_210] Importantly for FOSS, the producer is not
responsible if he proves that he did not manufacture the product for
sale or any type of commercial distribution, nor that he produced or
distributed it within the scope of a professional activity.[^portugal_211] Again,
these rights may not be waived or limited in advance; any agreements to
the contrary null and void.[^portugal_212]

In sum, disclaimers of liability (either by the producer or the seller)
will usually be held invalid with respect to consumer users, to the
extent that the cited legal provisions apply to FOSS licenses.[^portugal_213] As
mentioned above, other than arguing that FOSS is not a “consumer good”
or a “product” under applicable laws, it can also be defended that there
is no commercial relationship between the parties (and thus, the
licensor is not a producer or seller) in most instances of a FOSS chain
of licensing. That being the case, consumer laws or related provisions
would not apply to the full extent. This line of argument is reinforced
by the free (gratis) nature of FOSS. However, the countervailing
argument could be made that this free nature is not definitive, as also
professional sellers provide software for free.

Finally, some FOSS licenses contain interpreting provisions, which limit
the contractual effects of these limitations or exclusions of liability
“to the extent permitted by mandatory applicable law”.[^portugal_214] It is
arguable that such safeguard provisions might secure the remaining
validity of the limitation or exclusion clause in an adapted version by
allowing competent courts to operate the reduction or conversion of the
invalid portion of such clauses, so as to comply with mandatory legal
provisions.[^portugal_215]

### The Copyleft Principle

#### Principle

A characteristic found in different (but not all) FOSS licenses is the
so-called “copyleft” principle.[^portugal_216] FOSS licenses that incorporate the
copyleft principle[^portugal_217] lay down by contract that everyone in the chain
of consecutive users, in return for the right of use that is assigned
(or licensed), needs to distribute the improvements made to the software
and the derivative works created under the same conditions to other
users, if he/she chooses to distribute or make available such
improvements or derivative works. In other words, software that
incorporates copyleft FOSS needs to be distributed or made available
subsequently as copyleft FOSS. As such, it is not possible to
incorporate copyright protected parts of copyleft software in a
proprietary licensed work.

The copyleft principle can restrict the commercial possibilities of the
software.[^portugal_218] Warnings have been issued for the dangers that companies
run if a negligent or vindictive employee were to incorporate a piece of
copyleft code in the code of proprietary software. In theory this could
mean that the company would be obliged to make its proprietary software
available under a copyleft FOSS license. Although caution is necessary,
the relevant question is whether these worst-case scenarios are
realistic under Portuguese law.

The sanction for incorporating copyleft code in proprietary software
will usually be restricted to either a prohibition to distribute the
software which is in breach or the obligation to remove this piece of
code from the program. If the unlawful use has caused damage to the
author, this damage will need to be redressed, but usually not beyond an
amount correspondent to the damage actually suffered.[^portugal_219] In any
event, it is unlikely that the owner of the proprietary software at
stake would be obliged to release all its code under the copyleft FOSS
license.

#### Copyleft Validity

The question relating to the validity of the copyleft clause coincides
with the question of whether a rights holder is able to validly lay down
the conditions under which composite or derivative works must be
distributed or made available. The answer to this question is
affirmative: while the rights holder of the original work does not hold
any copyright in the derivative work, he/she is entitled to determine
the conditions for the creation and redistribution of a derivative work
of the original work.[^portugal_220] A composite or derivative work can therefore
only be exploited subject to the consent of the copyright owner of the
original work.[^portugal_221]

Based on the copyright ownership of his/her specific contribution to the
FOSS, a rights holder is thus able to authorize a specific use of the
work, or link certain terms and conditions to it. That right to
determine the destined use or conditions of use of a work is clearly
stated in the PCA, namely in Article 40(b) — establishing the general
right to authorize uses of a copyrighted work, Article 41 — laying down
the general regime for such authorizations, Article 67 — establishing a
general exclusive right to use and exploit a work — and art.
68 — clarifying the broad scope of such right to use, and exemplifying
with instances of uses that correspond to acts of adaptation or creation
of derivative works. Therefore, the rights holder is entitled to lay
down a copyleft condition to the use of his/her works based on these
rights.[^portugal_222]

All rights are subject to abuse, including copyright. In particular,
contractual terms and conditions must comply with imperative legal
provisions — such as those regarding consumer protection and data
privacy --, as well as with morality and public order.

Under Portuguese civil law, an abuse of right is defined as an exercise
of a right in which the rights holder manifestly exceeds the limits
imposed by good faith, prevailing costumes of by the social or economic
purpose of the underlying right.[^portugal_223] An author can therefore not
exercise his economic and moral rights in a random way that conflicts
with the aforementioned principles. Yet, the exercise by a rights holder
of his copyrights by determining the terms and conditions of
exploitation pursuant to his/her entitlements under the PCA, the
Software Act or other related legal instrument cannot be deemed an abuse
of rights “per se”; in fact, only in exceptional cases and circumstances
will an author who invokes his copyright be liable to a claim of abuse
of rights.

Therefore, licensing a work under a copyleft restriction will in
principle not constitute an abuse of right, considering that the author,
in general, will be able to prove a legitimate moral or tangible
interest in selecting that form of “exploitation”. An example of such an
interest shared by most authors that select this private ordering model
is the desire to release and maintain the work under the FOSS
“ecosystem” or “commons”, also in a derivative or modified format.
Significantly, this “personal interest” echoes a similar public interest
motivation of such authors. Likewise, companies which have built
business models around distributing or making available software under
copyleft restrictions will as a rule have no difficulties in
establishing a legitimate interest.

However, it should be noted that the scope of copyleft provisions — and
by extension an author-licensor’s entitlement — covers only the original
work, derivative works and any composite works incorporated therein.
Independent works are outside the scope of a FOSS work and the copyleft
provision. In other words, the expansion of the scope of application of
any such provision to works outside the aforementioned scope could be
deemed an abuse of (copyright) rights, as it would purport to extend the
author-licensor’s exclusive right beyond that which is legally
permitted. Examples of such abusive copyleft provisions would be those
applying to works not covered by copyright (either excluded ab initio
from protection or already in the public domain) and independent works
stored on a similar carrier device than that of a FOSS license.[^portugal_224]

Conversely, an argument could be made that, being the FOSS license a
contract, it would be subject to the general principle of freedom of
contract, under which parties are free to stipulate the terms and
conditions of their agreement, subject to restrictions in the law.[^portugal_225]
In that sense, if the condition imposed on further distribution is
considered legally admissible, the licensee could be deemed bound by
such clauses, even if exogenous to copyright. However, it is noteworthy
that such restriction clauses might clash with competition law
provisions — e.g. prohibiting certain forms of tying and bundling or
restrictions on legitimate commercial uses[^portugal_226] — or even consumer
protection laws that prohibit restrictions or imposition of conditions,
as noted above.[^portugal_227]

Finally, it has been argued that copyleft restrictions may run contrary
to the exhaustion principle, with regard to the exclusive right of
distribution of tangible copies of software. However, the Software
Act — in articulation with the PCA — prescribe that any act of
distribution of tangible copies by the rights holder or with his consent
results in the exhaustion of the right to control the distribution of
that copy in the European Union, with the exception of the right to
control the further leasing and lending out of the program or a copy
thereof.[^portugal_228] Importantly, this “exhaustion” is designed to apply to
controlling the tangible copy lawfully released in the European market.
In theory, it does not affect the right of the author to lay down
certain conditions regarding the use of the (intangible) work on that
copy. As such, the conditions of use established in the license on this
work “run” with the tangible copy, as the sole authorization to exploit
the intangible work on that copy.

The above conclusions seem unaffected by the most recent CJEU decision
in UsedSoft v Oracle, where it was decided that Article 4(2) of the
Software Directive is to be interpreted “as meaning that the right of
distribution of a copy of a computer program is exhausted if the
copyright holder who has authorized, even free of charge, the
downloading of that copy from the internet onto a data carrier has also
conferred, in return for payment of a fee intended to enable him to
obtain a remuneration corresponding to the economic value of the copy of
the work of which he is the proprietor, a right to use that copy for an
unlimited period.”[^portugal_229] In fact, even in case of direct application of
the ruling in UsedSoft v Oracle to the fullest extent to FOSS licenses,
such application would likely not affect the validity of the copyleft
provisions to subsequent making available of that copy to downstream
licensees (or assignees).

### Damages

Damages caused by copyright infringement are compensated in accordance
with Articles 210 and 211 of the PCA, and generally applicable
principles of law relating to unlawful acts (non-contractual
infringements) and breaches of contract.[^portugal_230] Article 210, regarding
the unlawful identification of a third party as an author, restates a
general principle in the Civil Code and is therefore redundant. Article
211, on the other hand, is the key provision under the PCA concerning
damages, as it constitutes the national implementation of Article 13 of
the Enforcement Directive. It has been characterized as a long and
unclear provision of difficult articulation with the general
regime.[^portugal_231]

As with the general regime, Article 211 of the PCA entitles the injured
party in a copyright infringement to request compensation for the losses
and damages resulting from the infringement.[^portugal_232] It basically sets
forth two alternative regimes for the calculation of compensation by
damages.

The first regime, echoing Article 13(1)(a) of the Enforcement Directive,
covers economic and non-economic damages. Economic damages encompass:
(i) infringer’s profits[^portugal_233]; (ii) lost profits of the infringed party;
and (iii) emerging damages of the infringed party.[^portugal_234] / [^portugal_235] The
provision on non-economic damages in Article 211(4) of the PCA is less
clear, as it creates some tensions with the general regime for these
types of damages.[^portugal_236] Under the general regime, the calculation of
these damages follows the principle of equity, meaning that it takes
into account the degree of intentionality of the infringer, the economic
situation of both infringer and infringed party and other relevant
circumstances.[^portugal_237] By meshing these factors and introducing a certain
degree of deviation therefrom, the text of Article 211(4) of the PCA
might lead to an expansive interpretation of the scope of these damages
for copyright infringement; however, it is our view that such different
textual articulation merely impacts the method of calculation of
non-economic damages, leaving their scope unaffected.[^portugal_238]

The application of the second regime, which implements art. 13(1)(b) of
the Enforcement Directive, is subject to two conditions: (i) the
impossibility to apply the first method of calculation (i.e., it is
designed as an alternative to the first; (ii) the express acceptance by
the rights holder that the alternative method is used.[^portugal_239] Under the
alternative method, a minimum baseline amount of damages is established;
such minimum threshold is to be equal to the hypothetical remuneration
of the infringed party should he/she had granted the infringer a license
covering the infringing acts.[^portugal_240] This presumed license calculation
method — an innovation in Portuguese law — provides a less complex
alternative to the alternative described above, and should for that
reason become popular in judicial practice.[^portugal_241] Like the first method,
it allows rights holders to recover expenses; differently, it makes no
mention to non-economic damages.[^portugal_242] Notwithstanding, it is our
opinion, following some legal scholarship, that non-economic damages are
also recoverable under this second method.[^portugal_243]

Finally, Article 211(6) of the PCA stipulates that, if the infringer is
a repeat offender of the infringed party’s rights or the infringing act
is deemed particularly serious, the court may calculate damages by
cumulating some or all of the criteria in paragraphs (1) to (5). This
could be interpreted as an introduction of punitive damages for
copyright infringement. However, given that the provision basically
allows for the combination of both methods described above, and that the
presumed license method only applies if the first method does not, the
scope of the provision seems limited, likely resulting in adding density
to the calculation of non-economic damages based on equity.[^portugal_244]

Infringements of software copyrights follow the same regime as
infringements of every other copyright for damages purposes.[^portugal_245] The
aforementioned principles, measures and methods of calculation are
therefore applicable in case of copyright infringements of software. As
such, for software distributed under a FOSS license, infringements will
be sanctioned in the same manner; the specific nature of FOSS licenses
cannot be construed as a waiver by the author of these rights.

It is possible to argue that in an infringement of FOSS the damage to
the copyright owner will be limited, as the author has made his work
freely available via the internet. This argument, even if it is prima
facie coherent at least vis-à-vis patrimonial damages, does not always
apply. Besides establishing a reputation and recognition with the
related value creation, an author can have other reasons to make his
work *freely* available.[^portugal_246] The author may also have a direct
monetary advantage from the free making available of his work, such as
generating advertising revenue off the FOSS work (where the gratis
nature of the work potentiates its user base), providing related
services (e.g. management, consulting or development), licensing
proprietary add-ons[^portugal_247] or providing a dual licensing model.[^portugal_248] The
latter model encompasses a dual-track licensing scheme, whereby the
licensor grants first a copyleft license for a FOSS work, thus ensuring
its fast dissemination to a wide user-base; at a later stage, the
licensor makes available a second non-copyleft license against
consideration, targeted at interested parties wishing to use the work
without their own additions being affected by “viral” copyleft effects
of the initial FOSS license.

    38 and 39(1) of the PCA).

[^portugal_104]: See art. 11 of the Software Act and the discussion supra in the
    section “Copyright Contracts”.

[^portugal_105]: See art. 3 of the Software Act, covering both software developed
    by employees and software developed on the basis of a work made for
    hire regime.

[^portugal_106]: See ASCENSÃO 2011, pp. 98-111, discussing the legal
    qualification of FOSS and arguing, based on the complexity within
    the licensing chain, that FOSS agreements go beyond licenses and
    should be qualified as instances of joint ownership or shared
    ownership (“zur gesamten Hand”). For further development of this
    position, see J.O. ASCENSÃO, “Modelos Colaborativos em Direitos
    Autorais”, in Ensaios sobre o Direito Imaterial — Estudos em
    Homenagem a Newton Silveira, Lumen Juris Editora, Rio de Janeiro,
    2009, pp. 1-18.

[^portugal_107]: For an analysis of the general implications of art. 3 of the
    Software Act, see above section “Introduction to software under
    Portuguese Law, Authors/Beneficiaries”.

[^portugal_108]: See arts 16(1)(b) and 17 of the PCA. Art. 17(4) excludes from
    consideration as co-authors individuals that have merely assisted in
    the production and dissemination of the work. In the context of
    software, that would cover for example a tester or non-substantial
    bug-fixer.

[^portugal_109]: The idea/expression dichotomy results clearly from art. 1 (1)
    and (2) of the PCA.

[^portugal_110]: See the above cited art. 17(4) of the PCA.

[^portugal_111]: This “consultation” element is an essential element in the
    qualification of a work as “joint”, given that a certain “planned
    and concerted action” of co-authors is required. See ASCENSÃO 1992,
    p. 128. See also MENEZES LEITÃO 2011, p. 110.

[^portugal_112]: See art. 5(b) of the Software Act, using the term “derivative
    programs” for software subject to a transformative use.

[^portugal_113]: See art. 3(2) of the Software Act, establishing a legal
    presumption (juris tantum) that a work created within a company is a
    collective work. Arts 16(1)(a) and 19 of the PCA establish the
    general regime applying to collective works. It should be noted that
    in traditional commercial software production scenarios the
    application of the provisions in art. 3 will lead to the ownership
    of the copyright in the software being vested in the company or
    employer. See ROCHA & CORDEIRO, pp. 26-28.

[^portugal_114]: See art. 3(2) of the Software Act.

[^portugal_115]: See art. 16(1)(b) of the PCA.

[^portugal_116]: Art. 19(1) of the PCA. See ROCHA & CORDEIRO, at 26-28. See also
    above section “Introduction to software protection under Portuguese
    law, Authors/Beneficiaries”.

[^portugal_121]: These rules can be found in art. 18 of the PCA and are discussed
    below.

[^portugal_122]: See art. 17(1) of the PCA. The rules on co-ownership can be
    found in arts 1403-1413 of the Civil Code.

[^portugal_125]: See arts 1406 and 985 of the Civil Code.

[^portugal_126]: See art. 17(2) of the PCA. This rule is identical to that of
    art. 1403 of the Civil Code.

[^portugal_127]: See art. 17(4) of the PCA.

[^portugal_128]: See art. 17(3) of the PCA.

[^portugal_133]: See infra section “Moral Rights in FOSS”. On this topic, see
    also above section “Moral Rights”.

[^portugal_134]: See art. 20 of the PCA, using the terminology “composite work”
    (“obra compósita”). The Software Act contains no similar provision,
    although it does prescribe for an exclusive right of transformation
    of the computer program, as well as reproduction of the derivative
    work, under its art. 5(b), which mentions “derivative (computer)
    programs” (“programas derivados”).

[^portugal_135]: For composite works, see art. 20(1) of the PCA and, for
    derivative works, see arts 3 of the PCA and 5(b) of the Software
    Act.

[^portugal_136]: See art. 20(2) of the PCA.

[^portugal_137]: See arts 20(2) of the PCA (mentioning that the right is without
    prejudice of the exclusive rights of the author of the pre-existing
    work) and 5(b) of the Software Act (granting an right of
    reproduction to the owner of the pre-existing work in future uses of
    the derivative work).

[^portugal_138]: The copyright holders on the original work don’t obtain any
    rights in the derivative work. They can however, restrict or stop
    the exploitation of the derivative work. See F. DE VISSCHER & B.
    MICHAUX, Precis du droit d’auteur et des droits voisins, Bruylant,

    of a legal transaction is set forth in arts 285-294 of the Civil
    Code.

[^portugal_148]: See FLA, art. 1(1). See also
    <http://fsfe.org/activities/ftf/fla.en.html>: “Beneficiaries of the
    FLA assign the copyright in their work, and in countries where
    assignments of the copyright in a work are impossible, they grant
    the fiduciary an exclusive license (see §1(1) for details).
    Therefore, the FLA is designed to work in both civil and common law
    countries.”

[^portugal_161]: An argument to the contrary would likely seek the application to
    FOSS agreements of rules governing the lending (“locação”) agreement
    in arts 1129ff. of the Civil Code. See A.L. DIAS PEREIRA, “Contratos
    de Software”, in Textos de apoio ao Curso de Direito da Comunicação
    no ano lectivo de 1995/1996, A. Pinto Monteiro, Direito dos
    Contratos e da Publicidade, Coimbra, 1996 (hereinafter, “DIAS
    PEREIRA 1996”), p. 117, admitting the possibility of application of
    these agreements to end-user software licenses where the use of the
    software is authorized for free.

[^portugal_162]: See: GPL version 1, article 6; GPL version 2, article 6; and GPL
    version 3, article 10.

[^portugal_163]: See GPL version 3, article 10. The sections omitted in the
    citation refer to enforcement (first paragraph), “entity
    transaction” (whole second paragraph) and examples on restriction on
    the exercise of rights (part of third paragraph).

[^portugal_164]: See arts 217ff. of the Civil Code and, for electronic contracts,
    arts 24-33 of the Electronic Commerce Act.

[^portugal_165]: See DIAS PEREIRA 1996, p. 118, noting that the same are subject
    to the STCA. On the STCA, see above the section “Copyright
    Contracts”.

[^portugal_166]: See DIAS PEREIRA 1996, pp. 116-120, analyzing the issue from the
    perspective of the STCA. See also DIAS PEREIRA 2011, pp. 366-367,
    referring to both B2B and B2C agreements characterized by the online
    delivery of electronic files with download, and arguing for the
    validity of such agreements, even when based in pre-formulated
    standard terms and conditions.

[^portugal_167]: A typical example is provided in M. BAIN, “Spain”, in The
    International Free and Open Source Software Law Book,
    <http://ifosslawbook.org/spain/> (“in the code file header and with
    luck, in a COPYING.txt file or a /legal/ folder”).

[^portugal_168]: See Criteria 10 of the OSD, annotated,
    <http://opensource.org/osd-annotated>. Under the criteria that the
    “License Must Be Technology-Neutral”, the OSD notes that “Provisions
    mandating so-called *click-wrap* may conflict with important methods
    of software distribution such as FTP download, CD-ROM anthologies,
    and web mirroring; such provisions may also hinder code re-use”.

[^portugal_169]: See art. 24 of the Electronic Commerce Act, which applies to all
    contracts concluded via electronic or computerized means, whether or
    not they are deemed commercial.

[^portugal_170]: See art. 29(2) of the Electronic Commerce Act, clarifying that
    in cases of immediate online delivery of the good (i.e. software),
    the consumers' acknowledgement of receipt is not required. See also
    DIAS PEREIRA 2011, p. 367.

[^portugal_171]: Unless a legal exception applies.

[^portugal_172]: See arts 38-39 of the PCA.

[^portugal_173]: See A.L. DIAS PEREIRA, Direitos de Autor e Liberdade de
    Informação, Almedina, 2008, pp. 582-584, discussing the minimum
    rights of the legitimate software user and noting that even the
    private use of software requires, in principle, a license granted
    directly or indirectly by the rights holder.

[^portugal_174]: The same is true, e.g., for Spain. See M. BAIN, “Spain”, in The
    International Free and Open Source Software Law Book,
    <http://ifosslawbook.org/spain/>.

[^portugal_175]: Some doubts arise in connection with the fact that FOSS licenses
    are in English. Here, a distinction between professionals and
    consumers is required. For the first, it is also a use and custom of
    the sector that vast majority of technical documentation is in
    English, meaning that courts may accept that use of English language
    for the license is acceptable. As regards the second, no such
    argument is valid.

[^portugal_176]: See art. 41(2) of the PCA. See considerations above in sections
    “Copyright Contracts” and “Enforcing FOSS Licenses, General
    Considerations” on the potential application of art. 41 (and rules
    of formal requirements) to software agreements.

[^portugal_177]: See decisions from the Portuguese Supreme Court of April 21,
    1988, December 15, 1998, March 3, 2006, and July 1, 2008. For the
    legal scholarship, see: REBELLO 2002, pp. 85-86; A.M. VITORINO, A

[^portugal_178]: See art. 220 of the Civil Code. For an overview of the arguments
    of this section of the legal scholarship, see BESSA 2012, pp.1184ff.

[^portugal_179]: On the difficulty of distinguishing contractual breaches of
    copyright license agreements that translate into copyright
    infringement (because they impact on the core of the exclusive
    right) from those that merely translate into contractual liability,
    see ASCENSÃO 2011, pp. 1101-112.

[^portugal_180]: See arts 195-211-B of the PCA.

[^portugal_190]: Decree-Law 67/2003, of April 8 (as amended by Decree-Law
    84/2008, of May 21) (hereinafter, the “Sale of Consumer Goods Act”).

[^portugal_191]: See art. 1-B(d) of the Sale of Consumer Goods Act.

[^portugal_192]: For a discussion on this topic, see T. ENGELHARDT & T. JAEGER,
    “Germany”, in The International Free and Open Source Software Law
    Book, <http://ifosslawbook.org/germany/>.

[^portugal_193]: See arts 1-A(2) and 1-B(c) of the Sale of Consumer Goods Act.

[^portugal_194]: See art. 1-B(b) of the Sale of Consumer Goods Act. A similar
    definition of product (movable good) is found in art. 3 of Law
    383/89, of Nov. 6 (last amended by Decree-Law 131/2001, of April
    24), implementing Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 on
    the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative
    provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective
    products (hereinafter, the “Liability for Defective Products Act”).
    As such, the scope of this law does not extend beyond physical
    goods, and it would be extremely debatable to consider FOSS licenses
    covered thereby. Moreover, as noted above, the qualification of a
    FOSS license as a sale (or even lease) agreement, triggering the
    application of these provisions, is also arguable.See above section
    “Copyright Contracts”.

[^portugal_195]: See art. 3(2) of the Sale of Consumer Goods Act.

[^portugal_196]: See art. 4(1) of the Sale of Consumer Goods Act.

[^portugal_197]: See, in general, arts 798ff. of the Civil Code. See also art.
    12(1) of the Consumer Protection Act, which provides an identical
    mandatory right for defective services.

[^portugal_198]: See art. 10(1) of the Sale of Consumer Goods Act and the broader
    art. 16 of the Consumer Protection Act.

[^portugal_199]: See art. 3(2) of the Sale of Consumer Goods Act.

[^portugal_202]: See art. 6 of the Sale of Consumer Goods Act.

[^portugal_203]: See art. 6(1) of the Sale of Consumer Goods Act.

[^portugal_204]: See art. 12(1) of the Consumer Protection Act.

[^portugal_205]: See art. 12(2) of the Consumer Protection Act.

[^portugal_206]: Art. 16 of the Consumer Protection Act.

[^portugal_207]: This law has a similar concept of producer to that of the Sale
    of Consumer Goods Act.

[^portugal_208]: See arts. 1 and 4 of the Liability for Defective Products Act.
    Art. 3 defines products as movable goods, thus raising the same
    question vis-à-vis the applicability of this legal regime to FOSS
    licenses, as discussed above for the definition of consumer goods
    under the Sale of Consumer Goods Act.

[^portugal_209]: See art. 8(c) of the Liability for Defective Products Act.

[^portugal_210]: See art. 5 of the Liability for Defective Products Act.

[^portugal_211]: See art. 5(c) of the Liability for Defective Products Act.

[^portugal_212]: See art. 10 of the Liability for Defective Products Act.

[^portugal_213]: Although it is arguable that the Sale of Consumer Goods Act and
    the Liability for Defective Products Act do not apply to FOSS
    licenses, this issue as not been discussed in Portuguese case law
    and may vary in accordance with the specific context under which a
    FOSS license is provided.

[^portugal_214]: See GPL version 3, art. 17 (“Interpretation of Sections 15 and
    16”): If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability
    provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their
    terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely
    approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection
    with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability
    accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

[^portugal_215]: See arts 292 and 293 of the Civil Code on reduction and
    conversion of invalid provisions.

[^portugal_216]: Neither the principles (freedoms) of the Free Software movement,
    nor the OSD mandate the copyleft clause. Several FOSS licenses don’t
    contain a copyleft clause. Examples are the Berkeley Software
    Distribution (BSD) license and the Apache license.

[^portugal_217]: E.g., GPL version 3, art. 5, and GPL version 2, art. 2(b).

[^portugal_232]: See arts. 483 of the Civil Code and 211(1) of the PCA.

[^portugal_233]: The nature of infringer’s profits as an economic or non-economic
    damage under Portuguese law is a debated topic among legal
    scholarship. For a brief summary of that debate, see TRIGO 2012, pp.
    160-162.

[^portugal_234]: These include most expenses and costs with protection of
    copyright, such as those with investigation of the infringement and
    cease and desist thereof.

[^portugal_235]: See art. 211(2) of the PCA. Art. 211(3) contains a narrow
    concretization of this general principle on economic damages, and is
    of no consequence in the FOSS context.

[^portugal_236]: See TRIGO 2012, pp.162-163.

[^portugal_237]: See art. 496(3), and its articulation with art. 494, both of the
    Civil Code.

[^portugal_238]: We follow here the same reasoning of TRIGO 2012, p. 163.

[^portugal_239]: See art. 211(5) of the PCA. This second requirement, which finds
    no basis in the Enforcement Directive, seems difficult to
    understand. See TRIGO 2012, p.164.

[^portugal_240]: See art. 211(5) of the PCA.

[^portugal_241]: See TRIGO 2012, p.164.

[^portugal_242]: This presents a clear parallel to the absence of reference to
    “moral damages” in art. 13(1)(b) of the Enforcement Directive.
