## Introduction to software protection under Dutch law

### Body of law

In the Netherlands, the protection of software by copyright is regulated
in the Dutch Copyright Act (“Auteurswet”, hereafter: “Copyright Act” or
abbreviated as “CA”). This law transposes[^netherlands_1] the provisions of Council
Directive (91/250/EEC) of 14 May 1991 on the legal protection of
computer programs[^netherlands_2] (hereafter: “Software Directive”) into Chapter VI
of the Copyright Act.

As the Software Directive is transposed into the Copyright Act itself,
the regulatory regime for the legal protection of computer programs is
no different than for other literary, scientific or artistic works
(“works”). Chapter VI of the Copyright Act, however, contains special
provisions with regard to computer programs.

### Copyright Act: Object of protection

Chapter 1, paragraph 3 of the Copyright Act refers to the works
protected by copyright. Article 10, paragraph 1 states that, for the
purposes of the Copyright Act, works include (amongst others) computer
programs and the preparatory material.[^netherlands_3] Thus, all computer
programs,[^netherlands_4] including the preparatory material,[^netherlands_5] are subject to the
Copyright Act.[^netherlands_6] Note that the expression (in any form) of a computer
program is protected. Ideas and principles which underlie any element of
a program, including those which underlie its interfaces, are not
protected by copyright.[^netherlands_7]

According to Dutch case law, only works that have their own, original
character and posses the personal stamp of the author[^netherlands_8] can benefit
from copyright protection. This means that the work’s form must not be
derived from any other work, and should be the result of the
intellectual creation of human labour. Thus, the author should have made
it’s own creative choices, i.e. choices that are the product of it’s own
human mind.[^netherlands_9] There should be a creative performance of the author
that is reflected in its work. Thus technical, objective and inventive
works are not subject to the creativity that the Copyright Act
protects.[^netherlands_10]

The Dutch requirements that a work should have its “own, original
character" and that it should posses "the personal stamp of the author”
seems to differ from Article 1, paragraph 2, of the Software Directive:
“A computer program shall be protected if it is original in the sense
that it is the author’s own intellectual creation. No other criteria
shall be applied to determine its eligibility for protection”. Thus, if
a computer program is an independent product of own creation, the
requirement of originality should be fulfilled.[^netherlands_11]

Until very recently[^netherlands_12] the Copyright Act also gave limited[^netherlands_13]
protection for writings that are not original:[^netherlands_14] the protection of
writings (“geschriftenbescherming”), Article 10, paragraph 1, sub 1 CA.
However, according to Article 10, paragraph 5, computer programs were
already expressly excluded from this protection of writings.[^netherlands_15].

### Authors/Beneficiaries

The Copyright Act does not explicitly state that the actual creator of a
work is the copyright owner. Nevertheless, when one reads Article 1
CA — which stipulates that copyright is the exclusive right of the
author of a work,[^netherlands_16] or his successors in title, to communicate that
work to the public and to reproduce it, subject to the limitations laid
down by law — in conjunction with Articles 4 — 9 CA, it is made clear
that, in principle, the person who has created the computer program is
the author of the work and thus the copyright owner.[^netherlands_17]

#### Rules of evidence

Article 4 CA provides the statutory rules of evidence: the person who is
named as the author in or on the work or — for instance the name of the
person, or the user of, or the entitled party to the logo or
brand — shall be deemed the author of the work. If there is no such
indication, then the person who, when the work is communicated to the
public, is named the author by the party making the work known to the
public, shall be deemed the author of the work, unless there is proof to
the contrary. If the author is not named, the person who delivers a
recitation which has not appeared in print shall be deemed the author
thereof, unless there is proof to the contrary.[^netherlands_18]

#### Compilations

With regard to compilations, Article 5, paragraph 1, CA provides that,
if a work consists of separate works by two or more persons, then the
person under whose guidance and supervision the work as a whole has been
made or, if there is no such person, the compiler of the various works,
will be deemed the author of the whole work, without prejudice to the
separate copyright in each of the works.[^netherlands_19]

#### Joint works

With regard to joint works, Article 26 CA, provides that, when the
copyright in a work belongs jointly to two or more persons, it may be
enforced by either one of them, unless agreed otherwise.[^netherlands_20] The rights
to a joint work can, in principle, only be enjoyed if both authors agree
upon such enjoyment (Article 3:166 ff. of the Dutch Civil Code
(“Burgerlijk Wetboek”, hereafter: “Civil Code” or “CC”)).[^netherlands_21]

#### Fictional authorship

Article 6 CA states that if a work has been made according to the draft
and under the guidance and supervision of another person, then that
person will be deemed to be the author of the work. If the supervisor,
however, has provided such a detailed design of the computer program
that the final programming is nothing more than just a straightforward,
non-creative process, then the supervisor, in this event, is deemed to
be the author of the computer program.[^netherlands_22]

More importantly, Article 7 CA provides that, where the labour carried
out by an employee consists of the making of certain works,[^netherlands_23] then
the employer will be deemed to be the author unless otherwise agreed
between the parties.[^netherlands_24] Note that this article only applies to the
employer/employee relationship. Thus, if such a relationship is absent,
this article does not apply. However, in the event of, for example,
secondment, freelancing or traineeships, one of the parties has to agree
explicitly, by deed of transfer,[^netherlands_25] that the copyright will be
assigned to the company.

Public institutions, associations, foundations and/or companies which
communicate a work to the public (“openbaarmaken”) as its own, without
naming any natural person as its author, will be regarded as the author
of that work, unless it is proved that the communication to the public
in such a manner was unlawful, according to Article 8 CA.

### Exclusive rights

The author of a work has the exclusive right to communicate the work to
the public (“openbaarmaken”, Articles 1 and 12 CA)[^netherlands_26] and to reproduce
it (“verveelvoudigen”, Articles 1 and 13 CA)[^netherlands_27], subject to the
limitations laid down by law. The special provisions concerning computer
programs, as provided by Article 4 of the Software Directive,[^netherlands_28] are
implemented into Article 45j — 45n CA.[^netherlands_29] As a consequence,
communicating to the public includes selling or offering to sell the
carrier of the software, or making the software available for third
parties to consult. According to Article 45h CA, the rental of computer
programs is also a communication to the public. Reproduction includes
the normal use of computer programs, including the correction of errors
(Article 45j CA); the reproduction of a back-up (Article 45k CA); the
observation, study or testing of the computer program (Article 45l CA);
as well as the decompilation of the computer program (Article 45m CA).

### Exceptions to exclusive rights

Articles 15-17c CA[^netherlands_30] provide general exceptions to the copyright of
the author, including for instance the right to quote from works that
are communicated to the public by or on behalf of public authorities,
public lending rights and the use of works for teaching purposes.

Another exception is provided by the first sale doctrine[^netherlands_31] and
Article 4 sub c of the Software Directive, which stipulate that the
first sale[^netherlands_32] in the Community[^netherlands_33] of a copy of a program by the
rightholder, or with his consent, will exhaust the distribution right of
that copy within the Community, with the exception of the right to
control further rental of the program or a copy thereof. The ECJ decided
that this first sale doctrine also applies to standard software
downloaded from the internet: an owner of copyright in software cannot
prevent a perpetual licensee who has downloaded the software from the
internet from selling his ‘used’ licence.[^netherlands_34]

The Articles 45j — 45n CA provide the special exceptions to the
exclusive rights concerning computer programs, based on Articles 5 and 6
of the Software Directive.

#### Reproduction of software

Article 45j CA[^netherlands_35] provides that the reproduction of a computer program
by the lawful acquirer[^netherlands_36] of a copy of the said work, when this is
necessary for the use of the work for its intended purpose,[^netherlands_37] shall
not be deemed an infringement of copyright.[^netherlands_38] Such reproduction, in
connection with the loading, displaying or correcting of errors[^netherlands_39]
cannot be prohibited by contract.[^netherlands_40]

#### Back-ups of software

Article 45k CA[^netherlands_41] provides that the reproduction of a computer program
by the lawful user[^netherlands_42] of the said work, serving as a back-up copy,
where this is necessary for the use of the work for its intended
purpose, shall not be deemed an infringement of copyright.[^netherlands_43]

#### Ideas and principles

Article 45l CA[^netherlands_44] provides that a person who is entitled to reproduce
the software program, which includes the loading, displaying, running,
transmission and storage, insofar as these acts are necessary for the
reproduction of said work, shall also be entitled, while performing
those acts, to observe, study or test the functioning of the work in
order to determine the ideas and principles underlying it. The rightful
user is allowed to use tools such as electronic testing and controlling
tools.[^netherlands_45]

#### Decompilation

Article 45m CA[^netherlands_46] states that the making of a copy of a computer
program and the translation of the form of its code shall not be deemed
an infringement of copyright if these acts are indispensable for
obtaining information[^netherlands_47] necessary to achieve the interoperability of
an independently created computer program with other programs,[^netherlands_48]
provided that: a) these acts are carried out by a person who has
lawfully[^netherlands_49] obtained a copy of the computer program or by a third
party authorised by him to carry them out; b) the information necessary
to achieve interoperability is not already readily available[^netherlands_50] to the
persons referred to under a.; and c) these acts are limited to the parts
of the original program which are necessary to achieve interoperability.
The information obtained must not: i) be used for any other purpose than
to achieve the interoperability of the independently created computer
program; ii) be given to third parties except where necessary for the
interoperability of the independently created computer program; iii) be
used for the development, production or marketing of a computer program
that cannot be regarded as a new, original work or for any other act
which infringes copyright.

### Moral rights

The author of the work also has moral rights, or so-called personality
rights (“persoonlijkheidsrechten”).[^netherlands_51] These rights protect the
relationship between the author[^netherlands_52] and his work and includes the right
for the author of a work — even after assignment of his copyright[^netherlands_53]
 — (a) to oppose the communication to the public of the work, without
acknowledgement of his name or other indication as author, unless such
opposition would be unreasonable; (b) to oppose the communication to the
public of the work under a name other than his own, and any alteration
in the name of the work or the indication of the author, in so far as it
appears on or in the work or has been communicated to the public in
connection with the work; (c) to oppose any other alteration of the
work, unless the nature of the alteration is such that opposition would
be unreasonable; and (d) to oppose any distortion, mutilation or other
impairment of the work that could be prejudicial to the name or
reputation of the author or to his dignity as such. Personality rights
are inalienable, but some may be waived (see sub a), or may be waived in
so far as alterations to the work or its title are concerned (see sub b
and c), in accordance with Article 25 CA.[^netherlands_54]

### Term of protection

For all works, including computer programs, the term of protection is 70
years as of January 1st following the death of the author (Article 37,
paragraph 1 CA) or of the surviving author if more than one person is
the joint author (Article 37, paragraph 2 CA). If the author is a legal
entity this term begins on the January 1st following the first
communication to the public (Article 38 CA).[^netherlands_55]

### Special measures

The Copyright Act provides the measures for enforcing copyrights.
Besides the general measures, the Articles 31-36 CA set out specific
criminal sanctions against copyright infringers and provide
investigative powers for investigation officers. On the basis of these
articles, for instance, a person who intentionally infringes another
person’s copyright, or who intentionally (a) publicly offers for
distribution, (b) has in his possession for the purpose of reproduction
or distribution, (c) imports, conveys in transit or exports, or (d)
keeps for profit an object containing a work which infringes another
person’s copyright, is liable to a term of imprisonment of not more than
six months or a fine of EUR 18,500. If these acts are committed by a
person in the conduct of his profession or business, then that person is
liable to a term of imprisonment of not more than four years or a fine
of EUR 74,000. If a person acts in a manner stated under (a) to (d), and
there are reasonable grounds to know that the object contains a work
which infringes another person’s copyright, he is liable to a fine of
EUR 7,400. If a person intentionally acts in a manner stated under (a)
to (d), any means designed exclusively to facilitate the removal or
overriding, without the consent of the author or his successor in title,
of a technical device for the protection of a computer program, is
liable to a term of imprisonment of not more than six months or a fine
of EUR 18,500. A person who intentionally makes any unlawful alterations
to a work which is protected by copyright, or to its title or to the
indication of the author or impairs such a work in any other way that
could be prejudicial to the name or reputation of the author, or his
dignity as such, is liable to a term of imprisonment of not more than
six months or a fine of EUR 18,500. All these acts constitute serious
offences. Moreover, reproductions which are declared forfeit by the
criminal court shall be destroyed, according to Article 36 CA, or may be
handed over to the copyright owner, if the latter applies to the office
of the Clerk within one month of the judgment becoming final and
conclusive. Upon such handing over, ownership of the reproductions shall
be assigned to the rightholder. The court may order that the handing
over be conditional on payment by the rightholder of an amount of
compensation that shall accrue to the State.

According to Article 36a CA, investigating officers may at any time, for
the purposes of investigating offences which are punishable under the
Copyright Act, require access to any documents or other data carriers in
the possession of persons who, in the exercise of their profession or
business, import into the Netherlands, communicate to the public or
reproduce works, where inspection of such documents or data carriers may
reasonably be deemed necessary for the performance of their duties.
Moreover, on the basis of Article 36b CA, investigating officers are
authorised to enter any premises to investigate offences which are
punishable under the Copyright Act and to seize that which is subject to
seizure. If they are denied access, they may gain entry, if necessary
with the assistance of the police. They shall not enter a house against
the will of the occupant unless a special warrant is presented in
writing from — or in the presence of — a public prosecutor or an
assistant public prosecutor. An official report of such entry shall be
drawn up by them within twenty-four hours.

## Unprotected software and public domain software

As set forth above, only software that is original in the sense that it
is an intellectual creation of the author benefits from copyright
protection. Non-original software does not come into consideration for
copyright protection and can, in principle, be used freely. In the
Netherlands there is little to no case law about public domain software.

## Analysis of free and open source software under Dutch law

### Copyrights

One of the most important characteristics of free and open source
software (“FOSS”) is that it is developed by the efforts of many
programmers. The work evolves continuously through the improvements,
additions and changes made by the open source community. These
characteristics may have several legal effects. It is important,
therefore, to examine, for instance, whether FOSS could qualify as a
collaborative work under Dutch law; who owns the copyrights to FOSS
software; and are contributions in themselves protected works in the
sense of the Copyright Act?

#### Qualification of FOSS

More than any other type of computer program, FOSS is often the result
of collaborative work between software developers. Modifications to FOSS
can either be distributed as separate computer programs or integrated in
the initial computer program.

Whether the collaborators could be regarded as authors in the terms of
the Copyright Act depends, amongst other things (including the question
whether Dutch law applies), on the extent of their creative input. Under
Dutch law, each contribution may be protected under the Copyright Act if
it meets the criterion of originality, either as a separate computer
program or one which is integrated into the original computer program.
Often, small contributions such as “bug-fixes” will not be protected
under the Copyright Act, and thus, not all contributors will become
authors.[^netherlands_56]

It is important, therefore, to examine whether a contributor is the
author of their particular contribution to FOSS, as only the author has
the right to decide on the use of the work.[^netherlands_57]

If the FOSS is developed by an employed programmer, the employer, in
principle, will be deemed to be the author of the work (Article 7 CA).
If the employee is seconded, one can argue analogously that the
copyrights then belong to the hirer.[^netherlands_58] If a public or private entity
communicates the work to the public without naming any natural person as
author, that entity will be regarded as the author of the FOSS, unless
the communication to the public in this manner was unlawful. In all of
these situations it is better to avoid uncertainty by mutually and
contractually agreeing that eventual emergence of copyright on created
works will be transferred to the employer, the hirer or the (public or
private) entity.[^netherlands_59]

One can also think of situations where contributions by a number of
parties have led to the creation of just one work. The Copyright Act
does not provide many explicit provisions for cases such as these (just
Article 26 CA, regarding the enforcement of joint authorship).
Nevertheless, case law has developed the rules regarding the authorship
and ownership of works created by multiple authors. These rules
distinguish, on the one hand, situations where the work is the result of
such close co-operation between authors that individual contributions
cannot be separated from other contributions, and, on the other hand,
situations where the individual contributions are clearly
identifiable.[^netherlands_60] Notwithstanding any specific contractual
arrangements, if the contributions can be distinguished, then each
author enjoys a separate right on his own particular contribution. If
the contributions are all combined into one work, then all the authors
enjoy the rights on the work in joint ownership; this means the rights
can only be exercised with the consent of every author.[^netherlands_61]

Finally, copyrights on FOSS — just as for any other works — can also be
obtained by succession or transfer.

#### Rights of the original (co-)authors

As stated, the author of a work has the exclusive right to communicate
his work to the public and to make reproductions. This also means that
the author can forbid or allow others to take these actions. Many FOSS
licences do not restrict (*copyright*) the use of the software but allow
(*copyleft*) others to use it under certain conditions in order to
ensure the free and open character of the (modified) software.

#### Authors of modifications

As FOSS has developed, works are often built on the basis of another
FOSS work that has been created by other individuals. In this light, it
is important to distinguish between two *legal* ways of making
modifications which are set out in Article 10, paragraph 2 and Article
13 CA.

On the one hand, Article 10, paragraph 2 CA states that reproductions of
a work and other adaptations and collections of different works will be
protected as if they were separate works, without prejudice to the
copyright on the original work. Thus, if a modification to FOSS can be
regarded as a new and original work, it is a new copyright protected
work, and in principle, the exclusive right of the contributor.

On the other hand (which in practice is more likely), Article 13 CA
states that the reproduction of a work generally includes any partial or
total adaptation or imitation in a modified form, which cannot be
regarded as a new, original form. Thus, a modification to FOSS that
cannot be regarded as a new and original work is considered to be a
reproduction of the original work and, in principle, the exclusive right
of the person entitled to the original FOSS.

Certain FOSS licences stipulate that derivative works should be
distributed under the same licence terms as the original work. The term
“derivative work” is not known in the Netherlands, but Article 10,
paragraph 2 and Article 13 CA may provide guidance as to how it should
be defined.[^netherlands_62]

### Moral copyrights

Moral rights play a more important role in relation to FOSS than they do
for closed source software. The reason for this is because FOSS values
the recognition of contributors very highly.[^netherlands_63] Nevertheless, moral
rights may also conflict with the ideas underpinning FOSS: the right to
oppose any alteration of the work may conflict with the *freedom* to
tinker[^netherlands_64] or with forked projects. The Open Source Definition even
specifies that authors of FOSS cannot oppose the use of the software by
certain people and groups or for certain areas of application.[^netherlands_65]

However, in theory, the moral rights holders may oppose such
alterations. Nevertheless, in practise, acknowledgments are desirable in
FOSS communities. Many FOSS licences even oblige contributors to mention
their names and their modifications in the mandatory notice.[^netherlands_66]

### Enforcing FOSS licences

If the FOSS is used, or distributed, in a way that is not allowed under
the relevant FOSS licence and the law, then it amounts, in principle, to
copyright infringement. The rightholders — or any one of them, unless
agreed otherwise — can enforce their rights by seeking an injunction,
compensation for damages, surrender of profits and seizure or
destruction of the infringing software. In principle, licences do not
have enforcement rights such as these, unless they are given the
authorisation by the licensor. Most FOSS licences do not give this
authorisation. In order to enforce FOSS licences effectively, the Free
Software Foundation encourages the authors of FOSS to assign their
rights to the software to the Free Software Foundation.

As FOSS licences have important differences from “normal” software
licences, and most FOSS licences were developed from an Anglo-American
perspective, it gives rise to the question as to whether the formation
and content of the applicable FOSS licence would comply with Dutch law.
How should the licence be qualified? Who are the contracting parties? Is
its form and content valid under Dutch law?

#### Introduction to the Dutch legal system

For a good understanding of the Dutch attitudes to FOSS licences and to
appreciate the suggestions made about the contents of FOSS licences, it
is necessary to briefly explain the pillars of the Dutch legal system.

In general, Dutch law does not provide mandatory requirements for the
formation and content of an agreement. Thus, in principle, contracting
parties have a lot of freedom. Moreover, Book 6 of the Dutch Civil Code
provides a solid, though flexible, basis for contracting parties and
sets out provisions that regulate the relationship between the
contracting parties and the consequences of agreements. Most of these
provisions have an additional effect, but some of them are mandatory
(predominantly when regulating the relationship between professional
parties and consumers). As most provisions are reasonably balanced, it
is not necessary to include clauses in contracts regarding issues that
are already included in the Dutch Civil Code, unless parties explicitly
want to differ from these statutory provisions.

One of the most important principles in the Dutch Civil Code is the
principle of reasonableness and fairness (“redelijkheid en billijkheid”)
which is laid down in Articles 6:2 and 6:248 CC. This principle is
implied in all agreements and has both an added effect as well as a
derogatory one. It may have legal consequences on the agreement made
between the contracting parties, but it could also affect the validity
of the contractual terms in a way that the parties did not contemplate
or intend when they entered into the contract. For instance, a
contractual clause may not apply, if under the given circumstances,
according to reasonableness and fairness, a clause such as this would be
unacceptable.[^netherlands_67]

#### Nature of the agreement

FOSS licences are agreements that create mutual obligations for the
contracting parties. Although FOSS licences have not yet been “tested”
in Dutch courts, most commentators argue that open source agreements can
be qualified as a contract under Dutch law, in the same way as any other
software agreement can. A contract consists in the parties'
manifestation of their actual or apparent intention to be bound by
obligations and to give them legal effect.[^netherlands_68] FOSS licences are
generally referred to as licence contracts, which actually form an
unnamed category of contracts in the Dutch Civil Code. What the nature
of the relevant FOSS licence is, should be examined on a case-by-case
basis, in accordance with the intention of the parties. The object of
the licence is to regulate the private law aspects of the transaction of
the licensed rights, such as the extent of the guarantee granted on the
FOSS, and the copyright law aspects of it, such as the extent of the use
that the licensee is entitled to make of the copyright protected
FOSS.[^netherlands_69] Upon examining the legal nature of software licences, most
Dutch commentators argue that software licences should be seen as
conferring a right of use (“gebruiksrecht”) on the licensee.
Accordingly, a software licence must be regarded as an agreement whereby
the licensor grants the licensee permission to perform certain acts with
respect to a copyrighted work, which would otherwise be prohibited on
the basis of the licensor’s exclusive right on the work. The majority of
FOSS licences, therefore, do not substantially differ from most
conventional software licence agreements.[^netherlands_70]

#### Contracting parties

Who are the contracting parties to a FOSS licence? It is clear that the
licensee is one — this is the person who is using a copy of the
FOSS — but who is the licensor? The text of a FOSS licence does not
always contain a clear indication of the name(s) of the licensor(s), let
alone the address(es) of the natural or legal person(s) granting the
licence. As said, the question as to who is the copyright owner is a
factual one which must be decided on a case-by-case basis, taking into
account eventual subsequent transfers of copyrights. It is more
difficult to examine who the licensor is: this has to be established
according to the principle laid down in the *Haviltex* case. This
landmark case states that one should take into account the respective
expectations of the parties concerned.[^netherlands_71]

The licensor and the copyright owner can be the same person, but not
necessarily. Following the FOSS ideology one would argue that the
licensee receives the licence from all the other developers in the
chain. However, as the licence is not clear about the identity of the
licensors at each step of the development process, it is unclear for a
subsequent user to determine who he is contractually bound with. In
practice, little case law has emerged in relation to FOSS licences and
so the difficulty of ascertaining the identity of the parties to the
agreement has not raised any legal difficulties, yet. Nevertheless,
whoever the licensor may be, the licensee has a right to expect that the
(legal or natural) person granting the licence is indeed competent to do
so. The next question is whether the licence agreement is properly
formulated so as to bind the user.[^netherlands_72]

#### Validity of the contract

FOSS is made available to users in various ways. The terms of the FOSS
licence may appear in a variety of ways as well. For instance, for
online distribution, the terms of the licence may be programmed to
appear on the user’s computer screen display, or the user may download
the FOSS only after he has given his consent to the terms of the online
screen licence, by clicking the tick box “Yes, I agree to these terms of
use”. The user can also be linked to the licence terms somewhere else
online. In other cases, the user may even be expected to consult the
COPYING or LICENSE file that is distributed with the software. For
offline distribution, FOSS licences are often inserted in an instruction
manual or packed inside a box, or only communicated to the user when the
software is installed.[^netherlands_73] Do these acts constitute a legal agreement
between the concerned parties, under Dutch law?

Article 6:213 CC defines a contract as a multilateral juridical act
under which one or more of the parties assumes an obligation towards one
or more of the other parties. Juridical acts require an intention to
produce a juridical effect, an intention which is manifested by a
declaration (Article 3:33 CC).[^netherlands_74] The absence of intention
corresponding with that declaration cannot be invoked against a person
who interpreted another person’s declaration or conduct in conformity
with the sense which he could reasonably attributed to it in the
circumstances as a declaration of particular implication made to him by
that other person (Article 3:35 CC). Thus, the impression created by
someone’s apparent intention to produce juridical effects is enough
cause for it to qualify as a juridical act.

Article 6:217 CC provides that the multilateral juridical act is formed
by the exchange of an offer and its acceptance.[^netherlands_75] With regard to
juridical acts which are done for free (juridical acts for no
consideration, “rechtshandelingen om niet”), acceptance is presumed to
have taken place more rapidly.[^netherlands_76]

Note that contracts can be validly concluded via electronic means,
irrespective of whether a consumer is involved in the transaction or
not.[^netherlands_77] However, for electronic transactions by “Information Society
Services”[^netherlands_78] the Dutch laws requires that anyone who provides an
Information Society Service must make certain information accessible to
the recipients of the service in an easy, direct and permanent manner
(Article 3:15d CC).[^netherlands_79]

Moreover Article 6:227b CC provides that, before a contract is concluded
via electronic means, any Internet Society Service is required to give
certain information in a clear, comprehensible and unambiguous way to
the other party. More specifically, the Information Society Service must
indicate the different technical steps which must be taken in order to
conclude the contract,[^netherlands_80] and it should specify the technical means
for identifying and correcting input errors, prior to the placing of the
order. Before or during the conclusion of the contract, the Information
Society Service must make the terms available to the recipient in a way
that allows him to store and reproduce them so that he can access them
at a later stage. Failure to comply with the obligations of Article
6:227b CC can result in annulment of the contract or the contract can be
presumed null.

Besides that, a distinction should be made between professional users
and consumers, since one would expect that professional users, more than
ordinary consumers, would be aware of the FOSS licence. Moreover, the
user may also be bound to the terms of the licence by the sheer act of
reproducing, modifying or distributing the software.[^netherlands_81] The criterion
is, in our opinion, whether the user actually accepted the legal
consequences of his actions, and whether he accomplished these actions
with the specific intention of being bound by the licence.[^netherlands_82]

#### General terms and conditions

Moreover, FOSS licences generally take the form of a standard agreement,
or of general terms and conditions (“algemene voorwaarden”), insofar as
the terms of the licence are not individually negotiated between the
licensor and licensee.[^netherlands_83] For this reason, the European and Dutch
legislature have subjected the use of general terms and conditions to
legal requirements relating to the formation of such contracts, even if
a user has manifested his intention to be bound by the terms. Article
6:232 CC provides that the other party is bound by the general terms and
conditions even if, at the time of entering into the contract, the user
understands, or ought to understand, that the other party did not know
the content of the conditions. The intention to enter into the contract
needs to be directed to the applicability of the whole set of conditions
to the actual transaction. When accepted, the other party cannot invoke
the fact that he was not aware of the content of the terms.[^netherlands_84] The
other party must have been given sufficient opportunity to acknowledge
the general terms and conditions before, or during, the formation of the
contract (Article 6:233b CC). Specifically for contracts concluded by
electronic means, Article 6:234 CC provides that an Information Society
Service must make the general terms and conditions available to the
other party during, or before, the formation of the contract in such a
manner that allows the other party to store and reproduce them so that
he can access them at a later stage. If this is not reasonably possible,
the user of the general terms and conditions must inform the other
party, before the conclusion of the contract, of the site where the
conditions may be electronically consulted, and of the fact that a copy
of the general terms and conditions may, upon request, be sent
electronically or by other means to the other party. In determining
whether the other party was given sufficient opportunity to take notice
of the general terms and conditions, a Dutch court will make a
distinction between professional users and ordinary consumers. Thus, the
key question is whether the other party understood or must have
understood, by ticking a box “I agree” or by performing another certain
act, that he accepted the applicability of the general terms and
conditions.[^netherlands_85]

The manner in which FOSS licences are presented to the other party
varies considerably. Therefore, a case-by-case examination must be
completed to ascertain whether the FOSS distributor is complying with
the mentioned legal requirements and whether the mere act by a user of
downloading FOSS onto his computer constitutes a manifestation of
intention on his part to be bound by the licence agreement.
Nevertheless, in the light of the foregoing, we believe that the FOSS
community should adapt its licensing practises to ensure that the
contract formation process meets the requirements of the law.

### Waiver and liability

In the case of software one can think of three possible forms of
liability: liability resulting from a) breach of contract (Article 6:74
CC); b) tort (“onrechtmatige daad”) (Article 6:162 CC); or c) product
liability (Article 6:185 CC and following). However, most FOSS licences
contain provisions according to which the licensor limits all his
liability for damages which result directly or indirectly from the use
of the program. The question is whether such a (full) limitation of
liability is valid under Dutch law.

As a result of the principle of the freedom of contract,[^netherlands_86] a
limitation or exclusion of one’s liability in a “business-to-business”
relationship is, in principle, permitted under Dutch law. However, this
freedom of contract is restricted by a number of legal provisions. For
instance, limitation or exclusion of liability may not be contrary to
common decency (“goede zeden”) (Article 3:40 CC).[^netherlands_87] Thus, it is
generally accepted that an agreement which limits a person’s liability
for damages which were caused by his own deliberate behaviour, is void.
Similarly, liability for damages which result from a person’s own gross
negligence cannot be restricted. Also, if the agreement is not
acceptable according to the principle of reasonableness and fairness
(“redelijkheid en billijkheid”) (Art. 6:248, paragraph 2 CC), then the
agreement is invalid.[^netherlands_88] Nevertheless, limitation of liability for
software is not considered to be unreasonable per se. Thus, the
assessment of a limitation or exclusion of liability should be dealt
with on a case-by-case basis.[^netherlands_89]

Consumers or small businesses benefit from a protective regime.[^netherlands_90]
This protective regime states, in Article 6:233 CC, that a clause in the
general terms and conditions can be voidable if the clause is
“unreasonably onerous” (“onredelijk bezwarend”) when one considers the
nature and further content of the agreement, the way in which the
general terms and conditions are formed, the mutual knowable interests
of both parties and the remaining circumstances of the case.[^netherlands_91] In
addition, Articles 6:236 and 6:237 CC contain a “black list” and a “grey
list” (respectively) of terms that are either invalid because they are
regarded as unreasonably onerous to the other party or are terms that,
unless proven otherwise, are presumed to be unreasonably onerous. For
FOSS licences, it is important to note Article 6:237 sub f CC as this
article provides that a term is deemed to be unreasonably onerous if it
frees the user or a third person, in whole, or in part, from a legal
obligation to repair damage. The fact that most FOSS licences are
distributed for free constitutes an important factor to take into
consideration when evaluating the onerous character of the limitation of
liability. Nevertheless, circumstances may illustrate that the
limitation or exclusion of liability cannot be upheld.

Article 6:185 CC provides that the producer shall be liable for the
damage caused by a defect in his product, unless the product has not
been manufactured for the purpose of sale by the producer or for any
other form of distribution by him with an economic object; or unless it
has not been manufactured or distributed within the framework of the
course of his profession or business. Nevertheless, we argue that
product liability may possibly be irrelevant for FOSS, as software may
not be qualified as a “product”.[^netherlands_92]

### The copyleft principle

#### Principle

The copyleft principle, or share-alike principle, in FOSS licences
purports to perpetuate certain obligations under the licence from one
developer or distributor to another. Thus, everyone in the chain of the
FOSS licence needs to distribute the FOSS, including their own
contributions, and/or derivative works, under the same FOSS licence to
other users, if they choose to distribute such contributions and/or
derivative works. In return, the developer can make free use of the
FOSS, in accordance with the terms of the applicable licence.

#### Validity

The copyleft clause raises a number of questions under Dutch law. More
specifically, one could ask oneself how obligations are passed on to a
subsequent licensee and do the rights and obligations under a FOSS
licence bind the subsequent licensee? And thus, is a contract
automatically formed every time the FOSS is distributed?[^netherlands_93]

The question of the binding character of a copyleft clause is a matter
of the doctrine of offer and acceptance (as discussed above), and the
legal requirements regarding the presentation of the general terms and
conditions of sale to the other party. The licensee may obtain an
automatic licence from the initial licensor, but this does not mean that
the sublicensee has automatically accepted it.[^netherlands_94] However, the
sublicence may be automatically accepted if the acceptance can be
inferred from the conduct of the sublicensor. As already indicated, the
binding character of the copyleft clause is complex due to the fact that
the identity of the licensor(s) is/are not always made clear. All in
all, the process of the formation of a contract is a very important
issue with regard to FOSS licences.

In Dutch literature,[^netherlands_95] the copyleft clause has been interpreted in
light of the principle of the relative effect of contracts and of the
third party effects of an agreement. These principles mean that a legal
action between parties can only have an effect on those contracting
parties. Thus, third parties are not affected by a contract to which
they are not bound. As a consequence, the rights created under a
contract are relative rights: they are only enforceable against the
other party to the contract. The copyleft clause in FOSS licences may be
passed onto a sublicensee according to Article 6:253 CC. This article
states that an agreement creates the right for a third party to claim a
performance from one of the parties, or to appeal against one of them
regarding the observance of their agreement, if the agreement contains a
stipulation to that effect (a third-party clause) and the third party
has accepted this stipulation. A stipulation of the sort referred to in
the previous sentence (third-party clause) may be revoked by the person
who has stipulated it until the time that it is accepted by the third
party. An acceptance or rejection of the stipulation (third-party
clause) is made by a third party making a declaration to one of the
parties to the agreement. If the third-party clause has been made
irrevocable and it has been stipulated, towards the third party, for no
consideration, it will be regarded to have been accepted if the third
party did not reject it immediately after he obtained knowledge of its
existence. In the context of some FOSS licences, it is not clear whether
the licensee has accepted or rejected such stipulations. The
construction of the copyleft clauses in FOSS licences fails to
accurately reflect this process. The clause creates a relationship
between the licensor and each of the licensees, regardless of the number
of legal transactions between them.[^netherlands_96]

### Legal remedies

If one does not comply with the provisions of the relevant FOSS licence,
one may infringe the copyrights of the author and/or commit a breach of
contract. Notwithstanding the limitations and exclusions of liability in
most FOSS licences, Dutch law provides the rightholder with several
legal remedies for both situations. The most suitable course of action
may depend on the specific facts of the particular case.

#### Damages

For instance, on the basis of Article 27 CA, the author retains his
right — even after assignment of his copyright wholly or in part to
another — to bring an action for damages[^netherlands_97] against persons who
infringe his copyright. After his death, this right belongs to his
successors or legatees, until the copyright expires.

In addition to claiming damages,[^netherlands_98] Article 27a CA provides the author
or his successor in title with the right to request the court to order
anyone who has infringed the copyright to surrender the profits[^netherlands_99]
flowing from the infringement and to render account therefor. These
claims may also be filed by the author, or his successor in title,
partly or wholly on behalf of a licensee, without prejudice to the
licencee’s right to intervene in the proceedings instituted
independently or partly or wholly on his behalf by the author, or his
successor in title, in order to obtain compensation for the damage he
has suffered, or to obtain a proportionate share of the profits to be
surrendered by the defendant. A licensee may only file these claims if
he has obtained the authority to do so from the author or his successor
in title.

The Copyright Act does not provide specific provisions concerning the
accountability for the damages, the different kinds of damage and how
the damages should be calculated. One should, therefore, take into
account Section 10, Title 1, Book 6 of the Dutch Civil Code, as
discussed below.[^netherlands_100]

On the basis of Article 6:74 CC, every imperfection in compliance with
an obligation is considered to amount to non-performance of the debtor
and makes him liable for the damage which the creditor suffers as a
result, unless the non-performance cannot be attributed to the debtor.
Save to the extent that the performance is and will remain impossible,
the debtor is only liable if he is in default, on the grounds of the
Articles 6:81-6:83 CC (as described above).

Article 6:81 CC provides that the debtor is in default (“verzuim”)
during the period that the performance of the obligation is not once it
has become exigible and the requirements of Articles 6:82 and 6:83 CC
have been met, unless the delay cannot be attributed to him or it has
become permanently impossible for him to perform the obligation.

Article 6:82 CC states that default commences when the debtor is given
written notice of default (“ingebrekestelling”), in which the creditor
grants him a reasonable period of time during which he still may perform
in conformity with his obligation, and there is no performance within
that period. If the debtor is temporarily unable to perform or if it has
become clear from his attitude that a warning would serve no purpose,
then he may be held liable solely by a written notice to the effect that
he is held liable for his non-performance.

Finally, Article 6:83 CC provides that the debtor will automatically be
in default, without the necessity of a prior letter of formal notice to
perform or a notice in which he is held liable for his non-performance:
(a) when the obligation is subject to a time stipulation (expiry date)
and he has failed to perform within the specified period, unless this
time stipulation has another purpose; (b) when the obligation results
from tort (“onrechtmatige daad”, Article 6:162 CC) or when it forces the
debtor to pay for damages as meant in Article 6:74 paragraph 1 CC, and
the obligation is not performed instantly; or (c) when the creditor must
conclude from a communication from the debtor that the latter will fail
in the performance of the obligation.

In the event that the debtor is indeed liable, Section 10, Title 1, Book
6 of the Dutch Civil Code applies. For relevance to the FOSS context we
will only discuss some of the articles. Article 6:95 CC states that the
damage that has to be compensated by virtue of a statutory obligation to
repair damages (due by virtue of law), consists of loss to property,
rights and interests and other prejudice, the latter as far as the law
confers a right to damages therefor. According to Article 6:96 CC loss
to property, rights and interests includes the loss incurred and the
profit deprived. Also the reasonable costs (a) to prevent or minimise
damage which could be expected to result from the event which caused
someone to be liable; (b) for determining the nature and scope of the
damage and of the liable persons; and (c) for attempts to get
satisfaction via an out of court settlement, but, as far as the costs
under point (b) and (c) are concerned, unless, in the prevailing case,
the provisions for costs of litigation are applicable (Article 241 of
the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure (“Burgerlijke rechtsvordering”,
hereafter: “Code of Civil Procedure” or abbreviated “CCP”), and qualify
for compensation as loss to property, rights and interests. The court
estimates the extent of the damage in the manner that is most consistent
with the nature of the damage caused. Where the extent of the damage
cannot be assessed exactly, it will be estimated (Article 6:97 CC). Only
damage that is connected in such a way to the event that made the debtor
liable, that it, in regard of the nature of his liability and of the
damage caused, can be attributed to him as a consequence of this event,
is eligible for compensation (Article 6:98 CC).

Another important provision is Article 6:104 CC, which concerns the
estimation of damage and the surrender of profits. If someone, who is
liable towards another person on the ground of a tort or failure to
comply with an obligation, has derived profit from this tort or failure,
then the court may, upon the request of the injured person, estimate the
damage in line with the amount of that profit or a part of it.

#### Other legal remedies

As said, the Copyright Act gives the author of a work the exclusive
right to communicate the work to the public and to reproduce it, subject
to the limitations laid down by law. This means that the author can
prohibit others from performing these actions. The copyright owner can
also claim ancillary measures, such as a recall, a rectification, an
account of profits and a claim for damages. More specifically, Article
28 CA[^netherlands_101] provides that the rightholder may claim goods which are not
filed in the public records and which have been communicated to the
public in violation of the copyright of the author, or are unauthorised
reproductions, as his property. He may also apply for them to be
destroyed or rendered useless. The rightholder may bring a claim for the
surrender of the said goods so that they can be destroyed or rendered
useless. The same right to claim goods exists (amongst others) with
respect to monies that may be assumed to have been obtained by, or as a
result of, an infringement of copyright. The rightholder may also apply
for the destruction or the rendering unusable of goods (or the handing
over of goods — eventually on the condition of payment — so that they
can be destroyed or rendered unusable) which have been used to effect an
infringement of copyright. The licensee will have these rights as well,
so far as their purpose is to protect the rights he is entitled to
exercise.

Besides these copyright-specific measures, the licensor also has some
legal remedies on the basis of the law of obligations. For instance, the
creditor (i.e. the licensor) may immediately[^netherlands_102] demand performance
(“nakoming”) by the debtor (i.e. the licensee).[^netherlands_103] This is
specifically an effective remedy for demanding that a licensee make
available the source code of the distributed FOSS, as obliged by the
concerning FOSS licence, if he has not done so already.

Moreover, the creditor also has the possibility of rescinding the FOSS
licence, under certain circumstances. This is regulated by Article 6:265
CC which states that if a party fails in the performance of its
obligations, the opposite party is given the right to rescind the mutual
agreement either in its entirety or in part, unless the failure, given
its specific nature or minor importance, does not justify the rescission
and its legal effects. If performance is not permanently or temporarily
impossible, the right to rescind the mutual agreement only arises when
the debtor is in default (as discussed above). According to Article
6:267 CC, the rescission of a mutual agreement is effectuated by means
of a written notification from the party who is entitled to rescind the
agreement, addressed to the opposite party to that agreement. If the
mutual agreement has been concluded solely by electronic means, it may
be rescinded in a similar manner by means of a notice conveyed to the
other party by electronic means.[^netherlands_104] A mutual agreement may also be
rescinded by a judgment of the court upon a right of action (legal
claim) of the party who is entitled to rescind the agreement.

A rescission releases the parties from all obligations created by the
rescinded mutual agreement. If these obligations have already been
performed, the legal basis for performance remains effective, but the
law imposes an obligation on the parties to undo the performances they
have already received by virtue of the rescinded agreement. In
situations where the nature of the received performance makes its return
impossible, it is replaced by a compensation of its value, calculated at
the moment on which it was received. Where the received performance was
not in conformity with the obligation, this compensation is limited to
the value of the benefit that the recipient, in the circumstances, has
actually gained from the performance, calculated at the moment on which
he received it. Please note that the rescission of a mutual agreement as
it is used in this context has no retroactive effect, except that an
offer from the debtor to perform his obligation, made at a moment that
the creditor has already brought a right of action (legal claim) to
court in order to rescind the mutual agreement, will have no effect if
the court subsequently decides to rescind that agreement.[^netherlands_105]

## FOSS cases in the Netherlands

In the Netherlands, no cases concerning FOSS licences have been reported
yet (July 2010). A search in the case law on the website for the Dutch
judicial system (www.rechtspraak.nl) only gives twelve results
mentioning “open source”, none of which is really relevant to the legal
issues concerning FOSS licences. Two case does, however, briefly deal
with certain FOSS characteristics, but the court does not provide any
final thoughts.[^netherlands_106] does not address the question as to whether the
incorporation of open source software in Marktplaats'' own software is
allowed. Also, it does not address the question, as to what extent
Marktplaats is obliged to make its own software available, in the event
that such incorporation would be allowed. (Is Marktplaats obliged to
make available its own software (its “crown jewels”, as they themselves
call it), or only the part of the proprietary software that is
associated with the filter that is the subject in this case?)
Nevertheless, the Court finds that it is clear that there would be
necessary costs involved for making use of open source software and
incorporating open source software into Marktplaats'' own software.
There would also be costs involved for Marktplaats for adapting its own
software to the needs of the open source software. Moreover there would
be some drawbacks. Therefore, the Court considered that, in the event of
Marktplaats being required to install a filter, Marktplaats'' choice not
to use open source software is — given the crucial importance of the
software to Marktplaats — a perfectly legitimate one.\][^netherlands_107] Thus, as
stated earlier in this article, the Netherlands is still waiting for its
first “real” FOSS case before any certainty on the different legal
issues can be established.

## Legal procedures

### Parties

Depending on the circumstances of the case, the FOSS licensor may need
to enforce his rights either on the basis of an alleged breach of the
contractual obligations of the FOSS licence, and/or on the basis of an
alleged infringement of copyright. As previously mentioned, one of the
issues in this case is the difficulty of establishing the chain of
ownership of rights on the FOSS. A consequence thereof is that it may be
unclear who is entitled to institute proceedings against alleged
infringers. Therefore, one should first enquire who the parties to the
licence are. Also the question of authorship of rights with respect to
the FOSS is of importance to determine who is entitled to exercise the
exclusive rights on the software.

For instance, the authors of a work whose individual contributions
cannot be distinguished cannot exercise their copyrights without the
consent of the other co-authors; if the contributions can be
distinguished, each individual author may enforce these rights (as long
as the parties have not provided otherwise in a contractual
arrangement).

The enforcement of rights on a collection of works may be easier, since
the person under whose guidance and supervision the work as a whole has
been made has the power to institute legal proceedings against the other
parties.

If one has obtained a FOSS licence, one has become a licensee. The
licensee has a right to institute legal proceedings if he has obtained
the authority to do so from the author, or his successor in title
(Article 27a CA).

As there is a lot of uncertainty as to who legally has the right to
initiate proceedings, the Free Software Foundation has introduced the
Fiduciary License Agreement (“FLA”). The FLA intends to remove this
uncertainty by allowing authors to make the Free Software Foundation
their fiduciary in all legal matters.[^netherlands_108]

### Procedures

The rightholder can initiate different legal proceedings in the
Netherlands to enforce his rights under the Copyright Act and/or the
Dutch Civil Code. For instance, the rightholder can initiate
interlocutory proceedings (“kort geding”) at short notice, in an attempt
to put a halt to the infringement, or the impending or potential
infringement of its copyright. Interlocutory proceedings can only be
initiated in relation to a matter of urgent interest, but a copyright
infringement — or a threatened or potential infringement — is usually
considered sufficiently urgent to justify such proceedings. A hearing
can take place within a few weeks and it is often possible to obtain an
injunction within just six to eight weeks. The judge in interlocutory
proceedings (“voorzieningenrechter”) will render a decision on the basis
of his preliminary assessment. Normally he will issue such an injunction
if he is satisfied, by preliminary assessment, that the copyright is
valid and infringed.

Interlocutory proceedings may also be initiated by the copyright owner
to request ancillary orders, such as a recall, a rectification, an
account of profits and an advance payment for the damages, but the
urgent need for such measures must be clearly explained by the copyright
owner.

The copyright owner also has the possibility of requesting permission
from the judge in interlocutory proceedings to conduct a seizure for the
surrender of infringing goods at the premises of the alleged infringers
(see: Article 28, paragraph 1 CA). The copyright owner can also request
permission for a conservatory seizure of *any* type of goods, not
necessarily the infringing goods, as a security for a monetary sum that
he is claiming from the infringer. The copyright owner also has the
possibility of requesting a seizure of goods for the preservation of
evidence, on the basis of Articles 843a and/or 1019b and 1019c
CCP.[^netherlands_109] In such a case, the copyright owner must make it plausible
that the other party, who is not heard by the judge in interlocutory
proceedings, is infringing his copyright or that there is a serious
threat of this occurring; he must also demonstrate an interest in the
requested measures. After such a seizure for the preservation of
evidence, the copyright owner does not automatically gain access to the
results, but must put forward a specific claim for this access before
the court.

In very urgent matters, the copyright owner can request the judge in
interlocutory proceedings to render an “ex parte injunction” (Article
1019e CCP).[^netherlands_110] This means that the (allegedly) infringing party is
not heard. Ex parte injunctions are preliminary and can be requested in
cases with an extraordinary urgent interest, especially if irreparable
harm will be caused and normal (interlocutory) proceedings cannot be
awaited (*periculum in mora*).[^netherlands_111] It is necessary for the copyright
to be legal and valid at first sight (*prima facie fumus boni iuris*),
and for the infringement to be clear-cut actual and, at least, imminent.
In order for this to be seen as reasonable, the applicant should give
full and frank disclosure. The judge in interlocutory proceedings only
briefly assesses the request for an ex parte injunction on these
grounds. An ex parte injunction can be obtained within two to three
days. If the enforcement of an ex parte injunction is subsequently
lifted or if proceedings on the merits lead to a different outcome, the
enforcing party can be held liable for damages.[^netherlands_112]

Interlocutory proceedings, as well as the ex parte injunctions and
seizures, should be promptly followed by proceedings on the merits, or
the related preliminary injunction will lapse. Moreover, definitive
remedies, such as declaratory judgments, revocation of copyrights,
rescissions of agreements and the payment of damages cannot be awarded
in interlocutory proceedings. For such remedies, the rightholder should
initiate proceedings on the merits. Of course, the rightholder can also
request an injunction or ancillary orders during proceedings on the
merits, such as a declaratory judgment, a recall of the infringing
products, rectification, information about the distribution channels, an
account of profits, destruction of the infringing goods and/or the
materials for the production of the infringing goods, publication of the
decision, the payment of damages or the surrender of profits and the
payment of reasonable legal costs (provided that the copyright owner
proves that he has an interest in such measures).

In intellectual property rights cases, the successful party in the
proceedings is awarded a payment from the other party of all the
reasonable costs that he incurred in taking the proceedings (Article
1019h CCP).

    copyright protected work, but forms an integral part of the computer
    program itself: President District Court (“Rb”) Amsterdam 18
    November 1993, Computerrecht 1994, p. 129 with annotation by
    Meijboom. The District Court of Utrecht considered midi-files as
    computer programs under the Copyright Act, as well as phonograms
    under the Neighbouring Rights Act: Rb. Utrecht 7 May 1997,
    Computerrecht 1998, p. 259.

[^netherlands_5]: Art. 1 para 1 Software Directive states that “the term ‘\`computer
    programs” shall include their preparatory design material’'.
    Preparatory design materials include functional designs, technical
    designs, flow charts, data models et cetera, see: Van Schelven &
    Struik 1995, Softwarerecht, p. 27 ff.

[^netherlands_6]: According to the preamble of the Software Directive, the term
    “computer program” includes “programs in any form, including those
    which are incorporated into hardware; whereas this term also
    includes preparatory design work leading to the development of a
    computer program provided that the nature of the preparatory work is
    such that a computer program can result from it at a later stage”.
    The function of a computer program “is to communicate and work
    together with other components of a computer system and with users
    and, for this purpose, a logical and, where appropriate, physical
    interconnection and interaction is required to permit all elements
    of software and hardware to work with other software and hardware
    and with users in all ways in which they are intended to function”.

[^netherlands_7]: Preamble and Art. 1 para 2 Software Directive. Moreover the
    preamble states that “in accordance with this principle of
    copyright, to the extent that logic, algorithms and programming
    languages comprise ideas and principles, those ideas and principles
    are not protected under this Directive”, nevertheless “the
    expression of those ideas and principles is to be protected by
    copyright”.

    Romme).

[^netherlands_9]: This excludes, at minimum, everything that has a form that is so
    banal or trivial, that one cannot designate any creative work of any
    kind behind such form: HR 30 May 2008, ECLI:NL:HR:2008:BC2153 and

    ECLI:NL:HR:2013:BY1532. According to the Software Directive “no

    should be applied”~ “in respect of the criteria to be applied in
    determining whether or not a computer program is an original work”.

    of protection of writings without original character or personal
    stamp of the author: "33 800 Wijziging van de Auteurswet in verband

    January 1961, NJ 1962, 255 (Explicator) and HR 25 June 1965, NJ
    1966, 115 and 116 (Televizier).

[^netherlands_14]: Schedules, theatre programmes, catalogues, telephone directories,
    broadcasting data and other data sets that do not have an original
    character and that are intended to be made public are subject to the
    protection of writings: HR 8 February 2002, 2002, 515,
    ECLI:NL:HR:2002:AD6093 (EP Controls v GEC).

[^netherlands_15]: See: A. Meijboom, Recht en Informatietechnologie, 7.3.2.3, p. 11,
    September 1999.

[^netherlands_16]: According to Article 2 para 1 of the Software Directive “the
    author of a computer program shall be the natural person or group of
    natural persons who has created the program or, where the
    legislation of the Member State permits, the legal person designated
    as the rights holder by that legislation”. If the “computer program
    is created by a group of natural persons jointly, the exclusive
    rights shall be owned jointly”, according to Article 2 para 2 of the
    Software Directive.

[^netherlands_17]: As a consequence, if a one-man business is to be converted into a
    legal entity such as a private company with limited liability, the
    one-man business has to assign its copyrights to the successive
    legal entity. See: Rb. Den Bosch 26 April 1996 and Court of Appeal
    (“Hof”) Den Bosch 8 September 1997, Computerrecht 1998, p. 67, with
    annotation by Thole (Stuve v Hanekroot).

[^netherlands_18]: A copyright notice does not qualify, in principle, as presumptive
    evidence of authorship. The purpose of a copyright notice is to
    provide security for copyright or certain rights in countries that
    are not party to the Berne Convention or TRIPS, but are party to the
    Universal Copyright Convention. See: A. Meijboom, Recht en
    Informatietechnologie, SDU: The Hague 1999, 7.3.2. p. 13 and
    Verkade, Intellectuele Eigendom, Tekst & Commentaar Article 4,
    annotation 2, Deventer: Kluwer 2009. Nevertheless, the Dutch court
    can derive presumptive evidence of the copyright notice, if another
    name is mentioned on the software, on the basis of Article 177 Dutch
    Code of Civil Procedure and eventual Article 4 of the Copyright Act.
    See: Sub-district Court (“Ktr.”) Alkmaar 20 July 1998, AMI 1999, p.
    32. See also: Rb. Gelderland, 17 May 2013, FAWBG,

    separate (graphic) user interfaces (but: compare Pres. Rb. Amsterdam
    18 November 1993, Computerrecht 1994, p. 129, with annotation by
    Meijboom), source codes and/or sounds.

[^netherlands_20]: Besides that, Article 3:166 ff. of the Dutch Civil Code applies
    to the joint copyright as well, unless agreed otherwise. If one has
    developed software in joint ventures that are not a legal entity,
    such as a general partnership (“Vennootschap onder Firma”) or
    commercial partnership (“Maatschap”), problems may arise after the
    rescission of the joint venture, if no arrangement is made
    concerning the rights related to the jointly developed software. See
    for instance Rb. Amsterdam 18 November 1993, Computerrecht 1994, p.
    129 with annotation by Meijboom.

[^netherlands_21]: See: Hof 's-Hertogenbosch 25 May 1994, AMI 1996, p. 116, with

[^netherlands_23]: Thus, the employee should have the task of developing software.
    This means, on the one hand, that if an accountant develops a
    computer program — during his spare time or not — then this employee
    does not lose his copyright to his employer, because his task is not
    to develop software. See: Pres. Rb. Haarlem 29 August 1986,
    Computerrecht 1988/5, p. 254; Pres. Rb. Rotterdam 21 March 1989,
    Computerrecht 1989/3, p. 149; Pres. Rb. Den Bosch 12 July 1990,
    Computerrecht 1990, p. 256. On the other hand, if an employee does
    have the task of developing software, and develops it during his own
    spare time, then the copyright will be credited to the employee.

[^netherlands_24]: See Article 2 para 3 Software Directive. This article uses the
    wording “entitled to exercise all economic rights in the program”.
    The interesting question is whether non-economic rights, such as
    personality rights, stay with the actual author, the employee. This
    article applies to both private and public parties. See:
    Ambtenarengerecht Amsterdam 20 December 1989, Computerrecht 1990, p.
    141.

[^netherlands_25]: Article 2 para 2 of the Copyright Act.

[^netherlands_26]: According to Article 12 of the Copyright Act, communication to
    the public includes the communication to the public of a
    reproduction of the whole or part of a work; the distribution of the
    whole or part of a work, or of a reproduction thereof, as long as
    the work has not appeared in print; the rental or lending of the
    whole or part of a work, with the exception of works of architecture
    and works of applied art, or of a reproduction thereof which has
    been brought into circulation by or with the consent of the rights
    holder; the recitation, performance or presentation in public of the
    whole or part of a work or a reproduction thereof; the broadcasting
    of a work incorporated in a radio or television programme by
    satellite or other transmitter or by a closed-circuit system as
    referred to in Article 1 sub g of the “Wet op de
    Telecommunicatievoorzieningen”. This means that, more specific to
    computer programs, the communication to the public includes selling,
    or offering to sell, the carrier of the software, or making the
    software available for third parties to consult. According to
    Article 45h of the Copyright Act, the rental of computer programs is
    also a communication to the public.

[^netherlands_27]: According to Article 13 of the Copyright Act, the reproduction of
    a work includes the translation, arrangement of music,
    cinematographic adaptation or dramatization and generally any
    partial or total adaption or imitation in a modified form, which
    cannot be regarded as a new, original work. This means that loading
    the software onto the hard disk or making a back-up is also a
    reproduction, compare: Pres. Rb. Arnhem 24 January 1995,
    Computerrecht 1995, p. 68. Thus, the criterion is that there have to
    be two or more copies of the work in order to amount to a
    reproduction. It is not relevant whether the copies are temporary or
    permanent. See also: D.W.F. Verkade, “Intellectuele Eigendom” in:
    Franken (Ed.), Recht en computer, Deventer: Kluwer 1997, p. 195,
    Verkade, Intellectuele Eigendom, Tekst & Commentaar Article 45i,
    annotation 2, Deventer: Kluwer 2009 and Rb. Zutphen 29 April 1999,
    Computerrecht 1999/4 (DWSS/Van Meggelen et al.).

[^netherlands_28]: “Subject to the provisions of Articles 5 and 6, the exclusive
    rights of the rights holder within the meaning of Article 2, shall
    include the right to do or to authorise: (a) the permanent or
    temporary reproduction of a computer program by any means and in any
    form, in part or in whole. Insofar as loading, displaying, running,
    transmission or storage of the computer program necessitates such
    reproduction, such acts shall be subject to authorization by the
    rights holder; (b) the translation, adaption, arrangement and any
    other alteration of a computer program and the reproduction of the
    results thereof, without prejudice to the rights of the person who
    alters the program; (c) any form of distribution to the public,
    including the rental, of the original computer program or of copies
    thereof. The first sale in the Community of a copy of a program by
    the rights holder or with his consent shall exhaust the distribution
    right within the Community of that copy, with the exception of the
    right to control further rental of the program or a copy thereof.”

[^netherlands_29]: Please note that Articles 45j — 45n of the Copyright Act only
    apply to software as such, thus, preparatory materials are not
    included. See: A. Meijboom, Recht en Informatietechnologie, SDU: The
    Hague 1999, 7.3.2., p.10.

[^netherlands_30]: Article 45n of the Copyright Act provides that the Articles 5,
    16b, para 1 and 17, para 1 do not apply to computer programs.

[^netherlands_31]: J.H. Spoor & D.W.F. Verkade & D.J.G. Visser, Auteursrecht,

    Schelven & D.W.F. Verkade, Auteursrecht, Deventer: Kluwer 1993, pp.
    69-75.

[^netherlands_32]: Thus, this does not include, for instance, rental of the work.

[^netherlands_33]: In the Netherlands, the general copyright principle is based on
    international exhaustion. Thus, for the purposes of the exhaustion
    rule it does not matter where in the world the work is sold for the
    first time. Since the Dutch legislature has not implemented Article
    4 sub c into the Copyright Act it is not clear if the international
    or Community-wide exhaustion principle was applicable to software.
    In Pres. Rb. Den Haag 7 July 1995, IER 1995, 30 with annotation by
    De Wit, the court held that for software only Community-wide
    exhaustion is applicable. In ECJ 16 July 1998, C-355/96, IER 1998,
    35, with annotation by Arkenbout (Silhouette), the European Court of
    Justice decided that the first sale doctrine for trademarks provides
    for Community-wide exhaustion, rather than international exhaustion.
    The same applies to the first sale doctrine for copyrights. See: A.
    Meijboom, Recht en Informatietechnologie, SDU: The Hague 1999,
    7.3.2, p. 22.

    absence of specific contractual provisions, the acts referred to in
    Article 4 (a) and (b) shall not require authorization by the rights

[^netherlands_40]: However, Article 5 para 1 and Article 9 para 1 of the Software
    Directive provide the possibility of agreeing otherwise. The Dutch
    legislature seems to have followed the preamble of the Software
    Directive, which states that it concerns mandatory laws, see
    Explanatory Memorandum TK 1991-1992, 22 531, no. 3, p. 12.

[^netherlands_41]: Implementing Article 5 para 2 of the Software Directive: “The
    making of a back-up copy by a person having a right to use the
    computer program may not be prevented by contract insofar as it is
    necessary for that use”.

[^netherlands_42]: Although the Copyright Act does not define “rightful user”
    (“rechtmatige gebruiker”), it is generally understood that the
    rightful user is the person to whom the owner has made available the
    program (including resale), and also any subsequent purchasers of
    units for which the distribution right is exhausted. See: Rb.
    Dordrecht 11 August 2010, Case no. 78465 / HA ZA 08-2747,
    ECLI:NL:RBDOR:2010:BN3863.

[^netherlands_43]: A. Meijboom, Recht en Informatietechnologie, SDU: Den Haag 1999,

[^netherlands_44]: Implementing Article 5 para 3 of the Software Directive: “The
    person having a right to use a copy of a computer program shall be
    entitled, without the authorization of the rights holder, to
    observe, study or test the functioning of the program in order to
    determine the ideas and principles which underlie any element of the
    program if he does so while performing any of the acts of loading,
    displaying, running, transmitting or storing the program which he is
    entitled to do”.

[^netherlands_45]: Explanatory Memorandum, TK 1991-1992, 22 531, nr 3, p. 14.

[^netherlands_46]: Implementing Article 6 of the Software Directive: “1. The
    authorization of the rights holder shall not be required where
    reproduction of the code and translation of its form within the
    meaning of Article 4 (a) and (b) are indispensable to obtain
    information necessary to achieve the interoperability of an
    independently created computer program with other programs, provided
    that the following conditions are met: (a) these acts are performed
    by the licensee or by another person having a right to use a copy of
    a program, or on their behalf by a person authorized to do so; (b)
    the information necessary to achieve interoperability has not
    previously been readily available to the persons referred to in
    subparagraph (a); and (c) these acts are confined to the parts of
    the original program which are necessary to achieve
    interoperability; 2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not permit
    the information obtained through its application: (a) to be used for
    goals other than to achieve the interoperability of the
    independently created computer program; (b) to be given to others,
    except when necessary for the interoperability of the independently
    created computer program; or (c) to be used for the development,
    production or marketing of a computer program substantially similar
    in its expression, or for any other act which infringes copyright.
    3. In accordance with the provisions of the Berne Convention for the
    protection of Literary and Artistic Works, the provisions of this
    Article may not be interpreted in such a way as to allow its
    application to be used in a manner which unreasonably prejudices the
    right holder’s legitimate interests or conflicts with a normal
    exploitation of the computer program.” The Community legislature
    aimed this article at software producers so that they would make the
    information available and to stimulate the development of open
    systems. See Explanatory Memorandum TK 1991-1992, 22 531, no. 5, pp.
    31-32.

[^netherlands_51]: According to Article 25 of the Copyright Act, personality rights
    include the right to oppose the communication to the public of the
    work without acknowledgement of the author’s name or other
    indication of the author, unless such opposition would be
    unreasonable; the right to oppose a communication to the public of
    the work under a name other than the author’s own, and any
    alteration in the name of the work or the indication of the author,
    in so far as it appears on or in the work, or has been communicated
    to the public in connection with the work; the right to oppose any
    other alteration of the work, unless the nature of the alteration is
    such that opposition would be unreasonable; the right to oppose any
    distortion, mutilation or other impairment of the work that could be
    prejudicial to the name or reputation of the author or to his
    dignity as such.

[^netherlands_55]: Implemented into the Copyright Act on 29 Dec 1995 because of the

[^netherlands_57]: One can also think of, for instance, a committee of experts, who
    examine whether contributions should be implemented into new

[^netherlands_63]: See: Eric S. Raymond, The Cathedral and the Bazaar, O’Reilly,
    1999, p. 53: “The *utility function* Linux hackers are maximizing is
    not classically economic, but is the intangible of their own ego
    satisfaction and reputation among other hackers. (One may call their
    motivation *altruistic*, but this ignores the fact that altruism is
    itself a form of ego satisfaction for the altruist). Voluntary
    cultures that work this way are not actually uncommon; another in
    which I have long participated is science fiction fandom, which
    unlike hackerdom has long explicitly recognized *egoboo*
    (ego-boosting, or the enhancement of one’s reputation among other
    fans) as the basic drive behind volunteer activity”.

[^netherlands_74]: The declaration of intention can be made in any form, thus it may
    also be inferred from conduct.

[^netherlands_75]: Which can take place in any form, unless the parties have agreed
    otherwise. Thus, also offer and acceptance exchanged via electronic

    Civil Code by Aanpassingswet richtlijn inzake elektronische handel,
    Stb. 2004, no. 210.

[^netherlands_78]: Any service normally provided for remuneration, at a distance, by
    electronic means and at the individual request of a recipient of
    services. The Explanatory Memorandum of the Dutch implementation act
    (TK 2001-2002, 28 197, no. 3, p. 12), explains that this expression
    should be understood in broad terms and should not be limited to
    services where a contract must be concluded; it should also be
    understood as covering activities for which the buyer pays nothing,
    if these activities are generally offered against the payment of a
    price or if they otherwise possess a certain economic value. Thus,
    the vast majority of FOSS distributors on the Internet could
    constitute an economic activity that should be covered by the
    definition of Internet Society Service. See: L. Guibault and O. van
    Daalen, Unravelling the Myth around Open Source Licenses — An
    Analysis from A Dutch and European Law Perspective, ITeR series no.

[^netherlands_79]: For instance the Information Society Service must supply its name
    and geographic address, as well as its electronic mail address, in
    order to allow rapid contact and communication in a direct and
    effective manner. Dutch law also provides similar obligations
    vis-à-vis information on suppliers of goods and providers of
    services to consumers (Article 7:46a ff. Dutch Civil Code), as a
    result of the implementation of Directive 97/7/EC of the European
    Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 1997 on the Protection of
    Consumers in Respect of Distance Contracts, OJ, L 144, 4 June 1997,

[^netherlands_83]: A term must be regarded as “not individually negotiated” where it
    has been drafted in advance and the licensee has not been able to
    influence the substance of the term, particularly in the context of
    a pre-formulated standard contract. See: L. Guibault and O. van

[^netherlands_86]: This principle means that parties to an agreement are, in
    principle, free to determine the content of that agreement.

[^netherlands_87]: For instance, restricting or disclaiming the legal liability of a
    seller or supplier in the event of the death of a consumer, or
    personal injury caused by an act or omission of that seller or
    supplier.

[^netherlands_88]: HR 19 May 1967, 1967 No. 261 (Saladin v HBU): all relevant
    circumstances should be taken into account, including but not
    limited to the seriousness of the gross negligence, in particular in
    relation to the nature and gravity of the related interests; the
    nature and content of the agreement; the social position of the
    parties and their mutual relationship; the way in which the
    agreement was formed and the degree of consensus of agreement with
    the other party. Following this case, more relevant circumstances
    were suggested by legal scholars, some of which the Dutch Supreme
    Court has followed, for instance if there is a disparity between the
    price of goods and the possibility of damages, a disclaimer should
    be considered reasonable; and the possibility of insurance.

[^netherlands_90]: A company employing fewer than 50 employees, or other small
    businesses that are comparable to consumers, as they have a weaker
    bargaining position. Thus, such companies benefit from the reflex
    effect (“reflexwerking”) of a protective legal regime.

[^netherlands_91]: However, this regime does not apply to terms that deal with the
    definition of the main object of the contract, or with the adequacy
    of the price and remuneration in relation to the goods or services
    supplied, insofar as these terms are in plain intelligible language
    (“kernbedingen”). The unfairness of contractual terms is to be
    assessed in light of the nature of the goods or services for which
    the contract was concluded and all the circumstances attending the
    conclusion of the contract, as well as all the other terms of the
    contract. See: L. Guibault and O. van Daalen, Unravelling the Myth
    around Open Source Licenses — An Analysis from A Dutch and European
    Law Perspective, ITeR series no. 8, The Hague: TMC Asser Press 2006,
    pp. 83-84.

[^netherlands_92]: However, this is not a clear-cut case. A product is a physical
    object subject to human control. One can argue that software is not
    “physical” (notwithstanding its physical carrier), and thus not a
    product (nor is the developer a producer). See: W. Dammers and M.

[^netherlands_96]: The original licensor offers the FOSS under a FOSS licence. The
    licensee acquires the FOSS from the licensor. The sublicensee
    acquires the FOSS from the licensee. If the sublicensee distributes
    the FOSS without the FOSS licence.

[^netherlands_97]: Such as the loss of royalties and damages which are not financial
    losses (Article 6:106 Dutch Civil Code).

[^netherlands_98]: Although the wording of the article is in addition to claiming
    damages (“naast schadevergoeding”), HR 14 April 2000, NJ 2000, 489,
    AMI 2000, p. 134, ECLI:NL:HR:2000:AA5519 (Danestyle v HBS) held that
    the aggrieved party may choose between these actions, whichever is
    more beneficial: a claim for damages or a claim for profits to be
    handed over. He is not entitled to claim both. See: Ch. Gielen,

[^netherlands_101]: Please note that these remedies may not be exercised in respect
    of goods in the possession of persons who do not trade in such goods
    and who have obtained them exclusively for private use, unless they
    have infringed the copyrights themselves. This article was
    implemented into Dutch legislation in 2007, as a consequence of
    Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
    of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual property rights.

[^netherlands_102]: If no term has been set for the performance. See Article 6:38
    Dutch Civil Code

[^netherlands_103]: When a term has been set for the performance, Article 6:39 Dutch
    Civil Code states that it is presumed only to bar an earlier demand
    of performance. The right of performance is regulated in Section 6,
    Title 1, Book 6 Dutch Civil Code.

[^netherlands_104]: Article 6:227a, para 1 Dutch Civil Code, applies accordingly.

    Procedure.

    ECLI:NL:RBZLY:2010:BP5690 (Purple Pigeon/Quinarx). In this case,
    Quinarx defended itself against an infringement claim that Purple
    Pigeon waived its copyrights because it used open source software.
    Although the defense isn’t described more clear, it is in any event
    incorrect: use of open source software, in any event, does not mean
    that the author waived its copyrights. Besides that, the court seems
    to state that the open source software does not *contaminate* Purple
    Pigeon’s own software since it was allowed to encrypt its code.
