## Introduction to software protection under United States law

### Body of law

Rights in software in the United States arise from a mixture of federal
and state law and the interpretation of those laws by the various
courts. Software may be protected by a combination of copyright, patent,
trademark, and trade secret law. Further, the licensing of rights in
software is subject to contract law, bankruptcy law, antitrust
(competition) law, uniform state laws, tax law, export control law, and
other specialized federal and state statues.

Copyright and patent protection of software arises under Section 8,
Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution.[^usa_1] The Copyright Act is embodied in
Title 17 of the U.S. Code, the statutes that implement the
Constitutional directive.[^usa_2] The Patent Act is embodied in Title 35 of
the U.S. Code.[^usa_3] Both copyright and patent law fall within the
exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. Federal government.

To the extent the publisher of software claims a trademark applicable to
that software, such trademark rights may arise under federal trademark
law, state trademark law, or common law rights in trademarks. Federal
trademark law is embodied in the Lanham Act, Title 15, Chapter 22 of the
U.S. Code.[^usa_4] State trademark law is generally embodied in state
statutes of the various states. In the U.S. rights in a trademark may
arise under common law from mere usage.

Software may also be protected by trade secret law. Trade secrets are
most commonly protected under a uniform state law (that is, a law that
has been adopted in substantially the same form among a large number of
states) like the Uniform Trade Secrets Act.[^usa_5] There is a federal
statute on trade secrets, as well, but it is less commonly relied upon
for contractual protection of software.[^usa_6]

Of the remaining areas of law that may govern a software license, none
is more important than contract law. Contract law in the U.S. is largely
within the purview of state law, and U.S. courts give contracting
parties a great deal of deference in determining the contractual terms
that will govern their relationship. As a consequence, parties may,
within limits, contract away rights and/or protections otherwise granted
under copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret law.

### Copyright protection of software

Software is protected by copyright and is equivalent to literary works
within the meaning of the Berne Convention for the Protection of
Literary and Artistic Works as established by the World Intellectual
Property Treaty of 1996.[^usa_7] Software was recommended for formal
inclusion under copyright in the U.S. in the final report of the
National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works
(CONTU)[^usa_8], the recommendations of which were incorporated in the
Copyright Act of 1976.[^usa_9] Inclusion of software under copyright was
further clarified with amendments to the Copyright Act adopted in 1980
that defined a computer program as “… a set of statements or
instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to
bring about a certain result” and by limiting the rights in computer
programs to assure the right of a lawful possessor to make a back-up or
archival copy of the program.[^usa_10]

It is important to note that in the U.S. copyright protection of
software extends to each of the source code and binary versions of the
software. While copyright in software arises automatically when it is
“… created and fixed in a tangible form that it is perceptible either
directly or with the aid of a machine or device”[^usa_11], enforcement of
copyright in the U.S. requires registration of the copyright with the
U.S. Copyright Office.[^usa_12]

### Authors/Beneficiaries

Section 102 of the U.S. Copyright Act (the “Act”) provides copyright
protection for “original works of authorship fixed in any tangible
medium of expression.”[^usa_13] Nothing more is required. Thus, whatever
ownership interests exist in the copyright commences with the reduction
of the expression to some tangible medium, whether paper or an
electronic file.

#### The sole developer

Section 201(a) of the Act provides that copyright protection in a work
“vests initially in the author or authors of the work.”[^usa_14] In the case
of a sole developer, copyright in the software code will vest with her
as the sole owner upon fixation of the code in a tangible medium of
expression. That is, once she types and saves the code, fixing it in the
computer’s memory, she now owns the copyright in that code. Nothing more
is required of the developer to own the copyright.

#### Works for hire

In the case of a developer writing software code within the scope of her
employment, the resulting work is known as a “work made for hire.” With
a work made for hire, “the employer or other person for whom the work
was prepared is considered the author for purposes of \[the Act\],” and
the owner of the copyright in the work.[^usa_15] The developer and her
employer may agree otherwise, where ownership remains with the
developer, through an express agreement in a written instrument signed
by both parties.[^usa_16] The intention of the developer and her employer,
expressed before the code is written, will dictate who owns the
copyright in the resulting work.

The result changes where the software developer is not an employee.
Software is not a form of copyrightable material that statutorily falls
under the list of special order or commissioned works within the scope
of works made for hire unless it constitutes a commissioned contribution
to a collective work.[^usa_17] Thus, the transfer of ownership of software
produced outside of the scope of employment must be supported by express
contractual language in writing.[^usa_18]

#### Joint ownership

Section 201(a) of the Act further provides that “\[t\]he authors of a
joint work are co-owners of copyright in the work.”[^usa_19] Joint
authorship in a work arises when “a work is prepared by two or more
authors *with the intention that their contribution be merged into
inseparable and interdependent parts of a unitary whole* \[emphasis
added\].”[^usa_20] The hallmark of joint authorship is the authors' “joint
laboring in furtherance of a preconcerted common design.”[^usa_21] That is,
each contributor must intend for their contributions to be merged;
however, it is not necessary that the contributors “work in physical
propinquity, or in concert, nor that the respective contributions made
by each joint author must be equal in quantity or quality.”[^usa_22]
Furthermore, it is not necessary that the contributors expressly agree,
in writing, to create a joint work.[^usa_23]

The touchstone of joint authorship is the intention of the joint authors
that their contributions be merged at, or before, the moment in time
when the contribution of each joint author is created.[^usa_24] That is, two
developers, who intend that the code they contribute to a project be
merged into inseparable and interdependent parts of a unitary whole must
express that intent before development commences, and each will own an
equal and “undivided ownership in the entire work.”[^usa_25]

So long as the intent to create a joint work exists prior to the
commencement of work, it is even possible for joint authorship to occur
“even though the joint authors do not work together in their common
design, do not make their respective contributions during the same
period, and indeed even if they are complete strangers to each
other.”[^usa_26] This situation is common among developers working
independently in developing software modules that are to be included in
a unified open-source project. The intent and timing of these developers
will dictate who owns the copyright in the resulting work.

The joint authors are the co-owners of a single copyright in the joint
work.[^usa_27] However, joint authorship is not the only means by which
joint ownership of a work may arise.

> A joint work will result under any one of the following circumstances:
> (1) if the work is a product of joint authorship; (2) if the author or
> copyright proprietor transfers such copyright to more than one person;
> (3) if the author or copyright proprietor transfers an undivided
> interest in such copyright to one or more persons, reserving to
> himself an undivided interest; (4) if upon the death of the author or
> copyright proprietor, such copyright passes by will or intestacy to
> more than one person; (5) if the renewal rights under the Copyright
> Act or the terminated rights under the termination of transfers
> provisions, vest in a class consisting of more than one person; (6) if
> the work is subject to state community property laws.
>
> —  1-6 Nimmer §6.01.

Each co-owner of a joint work “obtains an undivided ownership in the
whole of the joint work, including any portion thereof.”[^usa_28] In other
words, each co-owner may use or license the work, without the consent of
other co-owners, in any way she may wish.[^usa_29] Co-owners of a copyright
do, however, owe to each other a duty to account for any income derived
from their use or license of the work.[^usa_30]

#### The derivative work

The Act also protects derivative works and compilations.[^usa_31] A
derivative work is a work based in whole, or in substantial part, upon a
pre-existing work that recasts, transforms, or adapts the underlying
work in some way.[^usa_32] For copyright protection to extend to a
derivative work, “the additional matter injected in a prior work, or the
manner of rearranging or otherwise transforming a prior work, must
constitute more than a minimal contribution.”[^usa_33] Since most new works
are influenced, in some way, by a pre-existing work, there exists a fine
line between a derivative work and an entirely new work.[^usa_34] If a
developer uses very little of a pre-existing work, taking only code not
protected by copyright (like a basic function), or if she uses the
pre-existing code in such a way that the resulting program is
substantially different from the original, the new creation is simply a
new, original work of authorship and not a derivative work.[^usa_35]

Ownership of a separate copyright in a derivative work not only requires
more than a minimal contribution to the prior work, but also permission
from the owner or owners of the copyright in the prior work. Even with
such permission, the creator of the derivative work will own the
copyright in only that portion of the derivative work he contributed and
not in any portion of the pre-existing work upon which the derivative
work is based.[^usa_36]

#### Compilations and collective works

Finally, the Act protects interests in compilations, including
collective works.[^usa_37] A compilation is “a work formed by the collection
and assembling of preexisting materials or of data that are selected,
coordinated, or arranged in such a way that the resulting work as a
whole constitutes an original work of authorship.”[^usa_38] The preexisting
materials or data incorporated in a compilation may or may not, on their
own, be capable of being protected by copyright.[^usa_39] For example, a
program created by stringing together a set of basic functions (which in
themselves are not protected by copyright) may receive copyright
protection in the selection, coordination, and arrangement of such basic
functions.

Those compilations that do, however, incorporate preexisting material
capable of receiving copyright protection are known as collective
works.[^usa_40] The Act defines a collective work as “a work, such as a
periodical issue, anthology, or encyclopedia, in which a number of
contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
themselves, are assembled into a collective whole.”[^usa_41] For example, a
program that includes preexisting modules (which in themselves are
protected by copyright) may receive copyright protection in the
selection, coordination, and arrangement of the modules.

As with derivative works, for copyright protection to extend to a
compilation or collective work, “the additional matter injected in a
prior work, or the manner of rearranging or otherwise transforming a
prior work, must constitute more than a minimal contribution.”[^usa_42] In
the case of a collective work, the copyright in the prior work and
copyright in the collective work as a whole are separate and distinct;
the author of the prior work retains copyright ownership in her work,
while ownership of the collective work, including contributions made by
the author of the collective work, vests in the author of the collective
work.[^usa_43]

#### Joint works vs. derivative works vs. compilations

Joint works of authorship share similarities with derivative works and
compilations and, but for the intention of the authors, could be seen as
one and the same.[^usa_44] Depending on the intent at the time of creation,
one author’s recasting, transforming, or adapting of another author’s
preexisting work may create either a derivative work or a joint work
consisting of inseparable parts.[^usa_45] Similarly, depending on the intent
at the time of creation the assembling of the works of several different
authors into a collective whole may create either a compilation or a
joint work consisting of interdependent parts.[^usa_46] Which case applies
in each instance “lies in the intent of each contributing author at the
time his contribution is written.”[^usa_47] If, at the time of creation, the
author intends his contribution and those contributions of others “be
merged into inseparable or interdependent parts of a unitary whole” then
such a merger creates a joint work.[^usa_48] On the other hand, if the
intention to merge occurs only after creation of the work, then such a
merger results in a derivative work or a compilation.[^usa_49]

### Exclusive rights

The right holder’s exclusive rights to do or to authorize are set out in
Sec. 106 of the Act.[^usa_50] The author of software has the exclusive right
to reproduce the copyrighted work, to prepare derivative works based on
the copyrighted work, and to distribute copies of the copyrighted work
to the public by sale or other transfer or ownership, or by rental,
lease, or lending.[^usa_51] The exclusive right to distribute only pertains
to the original public distribution of a work and does not extend to a
subsequent distribution by a party holding legal rights in a copy of the
work.[^usa_52] However, a party receiving a copy under such subsequent
distribution remains bound by any contractual limitations to which the
original recipient agreed.[^usa_53]

### Exceptions to exclusive rights

#### Functionality exception to copyright protection

When developing computer programs it is inevitable that some of the code
will be functional in nature. As stated earlier, the Act awards
copyright protection to creative expression. “Functional elements and
elements taken from the public domain do not qualify for copyright
protection.”[^usa_54] Therefore, there is no striking similarity even
between two identical works so as to warrant an inference of copying to
the extent that, albeit copyrightable, functional considerations can
account for the identity.[^usa_55] What makes an element “functional?”
Elements are functional if they are necessary to the program and do not
exhibit any creativity. Aspects of a program’s structure which are
dictated by the nature of other programs with which they were designed
to interact are functional in nature and, thus, not protected by
copyright.[^usa_56]

Functional elements may also be dictated by the nature of the program
being developed. In *Computer Associates*, “the district court found
that the overlap exhibited between the list of services required for
both ADAPTER and OSCAR 3.5 was determined by the demands of the
operating system and of the applications program to which it was to be
linked through ADAPTER or OSCAR.”[^usa_57] These aspects of the program’s
structure are therefore functional in nature and not copyrightable.

For example, graphical user interfaces \[GUI’s\] generated by computer
programs are partly artistic and partly functional. They are a tool to
facilitate communication between the user and the computer. GUIs do
graphically what a character-based interface, which requires a user to
type in alphanumeric commands, does manually.[^usa_58]

In Lotus the court held that the Lotus menu command hierarchy is an
uncopyrightable method of operation.[^usa_59]

> The Lotus menu command hierarchy provides the means by which users
> control and operate Lotus 1-2-3. If users wish to copy material, for
> example, they use the Copy command. If users wish to print material,
> they use the Print command. Users must use the command terms to tell
> the computer what to do. Without the menu command hierarchy, users
> would not be able to access and control, or indeed make use of, Lotus
> 1-2-3’s functional capabilities.
>
> —  Id. at 815.

The menu command hierarchy in Lotus 1-2-3 is functional by nature of the
program and therefore not copyrightable.[^usa_60]

Other areas to consider when determining whether an element is purely or
primarily functional include:

1.  hardware standards;

2.  software standards;

3.  computer manufacturer design standards;

4.  target industry practices; and

5.  computer industry programming practices.[^usa_61]

An extensive discussion on the functionality exception to copyright in
software and its application may be found in an order of the Court in
*Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc.*[^usa_62]

#### Idea/Expression merger exception to copyright protection

Under the Act, in no case does copyright protection extend to any idea
regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated,
or embodied in such work.[^usa_63] “It is a fundamental precept of copyright
that only the expression of ideas, and not the ideas themselves, are
copyrightable.”[^usa_64] “Merely stating the rule, however, does not make
any easier the task of drawing the line between where idea ends and
expression begins.”[^usa_65]

> The line between idea and expression may be drawn with reference to
> the end sought to be achieved by the work in question. In other words,
> the purpose or function of a utilitarian work would be the work’s
> idea, and everything that is not necessary to that purpose or function
> would be part of the expression of the idea… Where there are various
> means of achieving the desired purpose, then the particular means
> chosen is not necessary to the purpose; hence, there is expression,
> not idea.
>
> —  Whelp Assoc. Inc. v. Jaslow Dental Lab

The characteristics of computer software, a utilitarian work, make the
determination of idea and expression more complicated. Competitive
forces that exist in the software marketplace lead to the problem that
multiple programmers may design identical or highly similar works.[^usa_66]

> Efficiency is an industry-wide goal. Since, as we have already noted,
> there may be only a limited number of efficient implementations for
> any given program task, it is quite possible that multiple
> programmers, working independently, will design the identical method
> employed in the allegedly infringed work. Of course, if this is the
> case, there is no copyright infringement.
>
> —  Id.

The merger doctrine is as an exception to the idea-expression dichotomy
which holds that, when there are so few ways of expressing an idea, not
even the expression is protected by copyright.[^usa_67] When idea and
expression merge such that a given idea is inseparably tied to a
particular expression, rigorously protecting the expression would confer
a monopoly over the idea itself, in contravention of the statutory
command. To prevent such an occurrence, courts have invoked the merger
doctrine.[^usa_68]

In the realm of computer programs, merger issues may arise in unusual
ways. Although, there may be many ways to implement a particular idea,
efficiency concerns can make one or two choices so compelling, as to
virtually eliminate any other form of expression.[^usa_69]

> Computer searching and sorting algorithms provide good examples of
> this phenomenon. Any computer system that deals with significant
> quantities of data will spend much of its operating time engaged in
> sorting and searching through that data. Because the amount of time
> spent on sorting and searching operations can significantly influence

> efficiency concerns.
>
> —  Id.

While the merger doctrine and the functionality exception to copyright
protection are similar, there is a slight difference which distinguishes
the two. “Under the merger doctrine, when an idea can be expressed in
only one fashion, that expression is not protected by copyright.”[^usa_70]
Here the focus is on the limitations of the expression of an idea which
results in the merger of that idea and its expression. In contrast,
elements are functional if they are necessary to the program and do not
exhibit any creativity.[^usa_71] In reference to the functionality
exception, the focus is not on the limitations on expression of an idea
resulting in merger of the two, but on aspects of a program’s structure
which are dictated by the nature of other programs with which they were
designed to interact.[^usa_72]

An extensive discussion on the idea/expression merger exception to
copyright in software and its application may be found in an order of
the Court in *Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc.*[^usa_73]. One important
aspect of this holding by the Court was that Java specifications
constitute unprotectable ideas and that it is only an implementation of
a specification that constitutes protected expression.

#### Scènes à faire in software exception to copyright protection

The Act does not directly define the scènes à faire doctrine. Scènes à
faire refers to aspects of a work that are indispensable or standard
parts of the material to be copyrighted.[^usa_74] “The \[scènes à faire\]
doctrine is often invoked to immunize from liability similarity of
incidents or plot that necessarily follows from a common theme or
setting.”[^usa_75] “Judge Leon Yankwich has called such incidents scènes à
faire, i.e., scenes which must be done.”[^usa_76]

> As was remarked above concerning merger, this doctrine does not limit
> the subject matter of copyright; instead, it defines the contours of
> infringing conduct. Labeling certain stock elements as “scènes à
> faire” does not imply that they are uncopyrightable; it merely states
> that similarities between plaintiff’s and defendant’s works that are
> limited to hackneyed elements cannot furnish the basis for finding
> substantial similarity.
>
> —  Id.

In *Durang*, the court found that alleged similarities that follow
obviously from the unprotected idea are therefore unprotected “scènes à
faire.”[^usa_77] The *Durang* court held that the lower court properly
applied the scènes à faire doctrine to hold unprotectable, forms of
expression that were either stock scenes or scenes that flowed
necessarily from common unprotectable ideas.[^usa_78] The *Durang* court
went on to explain that common in that context means common to the works
at issue, not necessarily commonly found in other artistic works.[^usa_79]

Further, under the doctrine of scènes à faire, elements of an original
work are not protected if the “common idea is only capable of expression
in more or less stereotyped form.”[^usa_80] “Beyond mere plot incidents
applicable to works of fiction, the scènes à faire doctrine can be
invoked throughout other copyright contexts as well; from guidebooks to
infomercials to Frequently Asked Questions web pages and beyond.”[^usa_81]

In *Gilley’s European Tan Spa*, “\[the\] plaintiff contended that
defendants infringed plaintiff’s exclusive rights under the Copyright
Act by preparing and displaying on their web page an unauthorized
Frequently Asked Questions page that mirrors the Frequently Asked
Questions page found on plaintiff’s web page.”[^usa_82].

> The Gilley’s court held a business cannot copyright a Frequently Asked
> Questions page as such or copyright words or phrases commonly used to
> assemble any given Frequently Asked Questions page. The format of a
> Frequently Asked Questions page is a common idea in our society; the
> elements of a Frequently Asked Questions page (a list of questions
> beginning with common words) are stereotypical. Some additional
> similarity beyond generic formatting is necessary to establish
> infringe-ment.
>
> —  Id. at 978.

Applied to computer programs, the merger and scènes à faire doctrines
suggest that if a limited number of options exist to achieve a given
function efficiently, interoperate with another application, or run in a
given environment, copyright will not permit exclusive control over
those program elements.[^usa_83] Scènes à faire is distinguishable from the
merger doctrine because, the merger doctrine holds that when there are
so few ways of expressing an idea, not even the expression is protected
by copyright.[^usa_84] The idea and expression are in essence, fused. In
contrast, scènes à faire relates to alleged similarities that follow
obviously from the unprotected idea.[^usa_85] The focus in scènes à faire is
not on the merged idea and expression or the limited number of ways to
express the idea, but on the similarities between expression in question
which are a natural result of the idea being expressed.

Moreover, scènes à faire is also distinguishable from the functionality
exception to copyright protection. While scènes à faire is expression
that relates to stock scenes or elements which are necessary to the idea
such as frequently asked questions or readme files, functionality
relates to aspects of a program’s structure which are dictated by the
nature of other programs with which they were designed to interact,[^usa_86]
such as hardware or software standards. As software development
languages become more and more sophisticated in the ready-made tools
they provide developers and as more and more developers, especially open
source developers, reuse standard or stock bits of code to carry out
standard functions, we can expect to see the scènes à faire doctrine
applied with greater regularity in software to deny copyright
protection.

#### Public domain exception to copyright protection

Works eligible for copyright protection may nonetheless enter the public
domain, i.e., no longer enjoy that copyright protection. For example, a
work whose copyright term has expired is obviously not protected.
Similarly, a work may have entered the public domain by reason of the
failure to satisfy certain statutory formalities of the Act as it
existed prior to 1978. In addition, an author may choose to lift the
protections of copyright and voluntary place the work into the public
domain.[^usa_87] “Moreover, copyright protection under the Act is not
available for any work of the United States Government, but the United
States Government is not precluded from receiving and holding copyrights
transferred to it by assignment, bequest, or otherwise.”[^usa_88]

What is the public domain? “A work of authorship is in the public domain
if it is no longer under copyright protection, it failed to meet the
requirements for copyright protection, or the holder of the copyright
disclaimed copyright in the work.”[^usa_89] Works in the public domain are
free for anyone to use without permission from the former owners(s) of
the copyright.[^usa_90] Material found in the public domain is free for the
taking and cannot be appropriated by a single author even though it is
included in a copyrighted work.[^usa_91]

> An enormous amount of public domain software exists in the computer
> industry, perhaps to a much greater extent than is true of other
> fields. Nationwide computer “bulletin boards” permit users to share
> and distribute programs. In addition, computer programming texts may

>
> —  4-13 Nimmer §13.03(F)(4).

Copyright protection is automatic and vested in the author the moment it
is created and fixed in a tangible form.[^usa_92] Voluntarily placing a
copyrighted work in the public domain requires some manifest expression
of the author’s intent.[^usa_93] Consequently, anyone considering reusing
code purportedly in the public domain should be cautious about assuming
that code to be in the public domain without some express statement from
the copyright holder declaring the code to be in the public domain. An
invitation to use with nothing more may be sufficient, but combined with
a requirement of attribution suggests the author is merely granting
permission to use while retaining the copyright and its various
protections. A more definite state, such as “as the author of this work
I disclaim the copyright in the work and declare the work to be in the
public domain” would leave little doubt as to the copyright holder’s
intent. The Creative Commons Copyright-Only Dedication statement gives
some indication of the complexity of committing a work to the public
domain.[^usa_94]

#### Facts in software exception to copyright protection

> Facts, whether alone or as part of a compilation, are not original and
> therefore may not be copyrighted. A factual compilation is eligible
> for copyright if it features an original selection or arrangement of
> facts, but the copyright is limited to the particular selection or

“In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship
extend to any … discovery, regardless of the form in which it is
described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.”[^usa_95]
Nimmer explains that the discoverer merely finds and records.

> He may not claim that the facts are original with him, although there
> may be originality and hence, authorship in the manner of reporting,
> i.e., the expression, of the facts. As copyright may only be conferred

How does this relate to computer software? In *WIREdata* an owner of a
copyright attempted to hide data in its copyrighted program.[^usa_97]
Specifically, the copyright owner attempted to use copyright law to
“block access to data that not only are neither copyrightable nor
copyrighted, but were not created or obtained by the copyright
owner.”[^usa_98]

> The information at issue in \[*WIREdata*\] was collected and then was
> slotted into plaintiff’s database. Defendant did not want that

>
> —  Id.

Within the framework of computer software development it will not be
unusual to find lines of code that merely make a factual statement. A
reference in a line of code to another place in the program, a table
showing equivalences, or a target name may all be merely factual
statements within the context of the software and, thus, not eligible
for copyright protection.

#### Fair use

Originally developed by the courts through case law, certain uses or
reproductions of a work protected by copyright are considered to be
fair, and thus, not an infringement of the owner’s exclusive rights
granted by copyright law.[^usa_99] In other words, fair use is a defense to
copyright infringement.

Section 107 of the Act contains a list of the various purposes for which
the reproduction of a particular work may be considered fair, such as
criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and
research.[^usa_100] In addition, the Act sets out four factors to be
considered by a court determining whether or not a particular use is
fair:

-   the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is
    of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;

-   the nature of the copyrighted work;

-   the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the
    copyrighted work as a whole; and

-   the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the
    copyrighted work.[^usa_101]

From a practical perspective, it is important to recognize that the fair
use doctrine is malleable — the court has wide discretion in its
application of the four factors to the particular facts of the case
before it. There are no hard and fast rules in fair use and the
difference between an infringing use and a fair use may be murky and not
easy to delineate. Using a work protected by copyright without
permission poses a substantial amount of risk. But for fair use, the
unauthorized use of a work protected by copyright is an infringement.
Unless the use falls within one of the permissible statutory uses, there
is no way to conclusively know whether the use is fair without costly
and expensive litigation.

#### Statutory limitations on copyright in software

Sec. 117 of the Copyright Act imposes statutory limitations on the
rights of authors or holders of copyright in computer programs by
assuring the right of a lawful owner of a copy of the software to load
that software onto a computing device and to make an archival copy of
that software.[^usa_102] This right to use or make a temporary copy also
extends to the so-called “maintenance or repair exception,” i.e., it is
not an infringement to activate a machine for maintenance and repair
purposes and incidental to such activation run the software installed on
the machine.[^usa_103]

### Moral rights

Unlike the copyright laws of many European nations, the United States
does not generally recognize moral rights in copyrighted works. The
exception lies with works of visual arts, such as posters, maps, globes,
motion pictures, electronic publications, and applied art.[^usa_104] As a
consequence, the ability to assert moral rights under copyright in
computer programs would be rare.

### Term of protection

In the United States the duration of copyright in computer programs is
dependent on the nature of the authorship. Where the computer program
was written by a single author on or after January 1, 1978, the
copyright expires 70 years following the death of the author.[^usa_105] If a
work was created by joint authors, the 70-year period is calculated from
the date of the death of the last surviving author.[^usa_106] Where the
computer program was written anonymously, under a pseudonym, or as a
work made for hire, the copyright endures for a term of 95 years from
the year of its first publication, or a term of 120 years from the year
of its creation, whichever expires first. Should the author or his/her
legal successor record his/her identity with the U.S. Copyright Office
prior to the date of expiration, the copyright term is calculated under
the general rules for known authors.[^usa_107] As to derivative works,
compilations or collective works, there is no special rule as both the
author of the preexisting works (if any) and the author of the
derivative work, compilation or collective work hold independent
copyrights. Thus, each protection term is calculated separately under
the general rule.

### Copyright assignment

Under U.S. copyright law the ownership of a copyright may be transferred
in whole or in part by any means of conveyance or by operation of law,
and may be bequeathed by will or pass as personal property by the
applicable laws of intestate succession.[^usa_108] Rights in copyright are
considered bundled and may be unbundled for purposes of license or
transfer, i.e., they may be licensed or transferred outright either
individually or in their entirety.[^usa_109]

To be effective, any transfer of rights under copyright, whether by
license or complete assignment, must be in writing and signed by the
holder of the rights in the copyright or that holder’s authorized
agent.[^usa_110] Such transfers may, but are not required to be recorded
with the U.S. Copyright Office; however, a failure to record an
exclusive grant may result in a preemption of such grant by a subsequent
grant if such subsequent grant is the first to be recorded, provided the
exclusive grant is not recorded within one month of its execution (two
months if executed outside the U.S.).[^usa_111] Nonexclusive licenses
embodied in a writing are not subject to such preemption.[^usa_112]

A unique provision of U.S. copyright law pertaining to licenses and
assignments is that all such licenses and assignments, except those made
pursuant to a work for hire, are subject to revocation by the author or
the author’s estate under certain conditions.[^usa_113] Such revocation may
occur only during a period commencing with the end of the 35th year
following the date of the grant (or if the grant includes a right of
publication, the end of the 35th year following such publication) and
ending at the end of the 40th year following the date of the
grant.[^usa_114] To effect the revocation, the empowered party(ies) must
serve notice of termination on the grantee under the license or
assignment.[^usa_115] An important exception to such termination is that
rights in any derivative works prepared under such grant and existing
prior to the date of termination shall survive such termination, but
only in the form in which the derivative work existed at the time of
such termination.[^usa_116]

### Enforcement

#### Infringement

Enforcement of copyright in software where infringement occurs is no
different than for other matter subject to copyright protection.
Infringement may be found where any of the exclusive rights of the
copyright holder have been undertaken without authorization.[^usa_117] In
order to bring a civil action for infringement the copyright holder must
record the copyright with the U.S. Copyright Office.[^usa_118] Registration
serves the dual purpose of establishing the earliest date for liability
for statutory damages and attorney’s fees.[^usa_119]

Only the exclusive holder of a right or all of the rights (whether the
original author, an assignee, or licensee) in copyright has standing to
bring a civil action for infringement.[^usa_120] The exclusive holder of
less than all of the rights may only claim infringement of those rights
held; it is not necessary for the exclusive holder of a right to join
the primary copyright holder.[^usa_121] Nonexclusive licenses have no right
to bring an action for infringement.[^usa_122]

Remedies available to a successful complainant may include injunctive
relief, impoundment and disposition of the infringing articles,
statutory damages or actual damages and lost profits, and costs of court
and attorney’s fees.[^usa_123]

Jurisdiction and venue in copyright cases only lies with the federal
courts.[^usa_124] This will be true even when breach of contract claims are
asserted so long as at least one claim lies solely in copyright and such
copyright claim is the primary basis of the suit.[^usa_125]

#### Breach of contract

Apart from the right to bring an action for infringement, licensor’s of
software may also bring an action for breach of contract where the
subject matter of the breach does not relate to rights granted under
copyright. As examples, the failure to pay license fees in a timely
manner, royalty rates, and a breach of warranty all constitute contract
claims. Unlike an action for copyright infringement, in a breach of
contract action only money damages are generally available and not
injunctive relief. A general exception to this rule would be in an
action for specific performance under the contract. Most importantly,
unlike copyright infringement where injunctive relief is a matter of
right, injunctive relief will only be granted in breach of contract
actions where such breach would result in irreparable harm that could
not be adequately remedied by money damages.

### Patent protection of software

Unlike copyright, patent protection of software is not automatic, and
such protection is largely limited to the jurisdiction issuing the
patent. Whether inventions contained in software constitute patentable
subject matter has been the subject of a great deal of debate and
evolving law in the U.S. Prior to the 1980’s it was generally believed
that one could not obtain a patent on inventions embodied in software,
as such software consisted primarily of algorithms and, by law,
algorithms were deemed unpatentable subject matter. This view first
changed in 1981 in the *Diamond v. Diehr* case when the U.S. Supreme
Court held that the use of an algorithm in software does not preclude it
as patentable subject matter so long as the claimed invention related
solely to the use of the software to solve a specific technological
problem and did not preclude all other uses of the algorithm.[^usa_126]

The interpretations of patent eligibility of software inventions
continue to evolve. The U.S. Supreme Court in the case of *In re
Bilski*[^usa_127] held that the machine or transformation test previously
adopted by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, i.e., “(a)
claimed process is surely patent-eligible under § 101 if: (1) it is tied
to a particular machine or apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular
article into a different state or thing,” constituted a test, although
not the sole test, of whether a process is patent eligible.[^usa_128] In any
case, inventions embodied in software remain patent eligible in the
U.S., but the scope of that patent protection appears to be narrowing.

A scope of a patent is defined by the claims asserted in the patent. In
patents related to software such claims generally define the broad
outline of the invention in terms of a process. Thus, the claims are not
limited to a particular embodiment of that process (or, like copyright,
to a specific set of written instructions) but may apply to an unlimited
number of embodiments so long as each embodiment incorporates each
element of one of the claims asserted in the patent. As a consequence,
patents related to software may be infringed by numerous computer
programs, and any computer program may infringe the claims of numerous
patents.

#### Exclusive rights

A patent holder in the U.S. has the exclusive right to make, have made,
use, sell, or import any product made by means of a claimed process or
product embodying the claimed invention.[^usa_129] As with copyright, these
rights may be assigned or licensed to another either in whole or in
part.

#### Exhaustion and implied licenses

Upon the unrestricted sale (as contrasted with the license) of a
patented invention all patent rights in the invention are exhausted,
i.e., the purchaser has the right to do anything with the purchased
invention without fear of a claim of infringement. Related to the
doctrine of exhaustion are implied licenses. When a patent holder
incorporates the patented invention in a product and sells the product
without an express license to the patent, courts will generally imply
the grant of license since the patent holder essentially invites
infringement. There is a line of cases in the U.S. that interprets the
boundaries of such exhaustion and implied licenses:

-   *Adams v. Burke*[^usa_130]  — claims that are directly infringed by the
    product are exhausted at the time of sale.

-   *Univis Lens*[^usa_131] — implied license in claims necessary to finish
    an incomplete product.

-   *Intel v. ULSI*[^usa_132] — implied license accompanies the sale of
    infringing goods by a licensed manufacturer.

-   *Cyrix v. Intel*[^usa_133] — implied license in claims necessary to make
    a complete product commercially viable (use for intended purpose).

In addition to these cases specifically related to patent claims,
licenses may be implied by courts for a variety of other legal and
equitable reasons. For example, the conduct of the two parties may be
construed as establishing a license. Also, equitable estoppel may be
found where a party knowingly infringes and the patent holder, knowing
of the infringement and objecting to such infringement, takes no action
to halt the infringement, misleading the infringer into believing the
patent holder will not act. Finally, a court may impose legal estoppel
on a patent holder who has licensed or assigned a right, received
consideration, and then sought to derogate from the right granted.

#### Term of protection

Patent protection in the U.S. is granted for a term of 20 years measured
from the date of the filing of the patent application for all patents
issued on or after June 9, 1995.[^usa_134] For patents issued prior to that
date the term is the longer of 20 years from the date of filing or 17
years from the date of issue; this transition term phasing out on June
9, 2012.

Effective March 13, 2013, the U.S. joined most other national patent
bodies in granting patent protection to the first party to file.[^usa_135]

#### Extraterritorial reach

Sec. 271(f) of the Patent Act[^usa_136] extends infringement liability to
any party who “without authority supplies or causes to be supplied in or
from the United States all or a substantial portion of the components of
a patented invention, where such components are uncombined in whole or
in part, in such manner as to actively induce the combination of such
components outside of the United States in a manner that would infringe
the patent if such combination occurred within the United States.” This
provision had been read to imply that the making outside the U.S. of
copies from of an infringing gold master provided by a U.S. software
developer would constitute additional infringing acts increasing the
liability of the U.S. developer. In the case of *AT&T v.
Microsoft*[^usa_137] the Supreme Court held that so long as the copies were
made outside the U.S. from a gold master provided from the U.S. no
liability accrued where the infringing act arises from the actual
loading of the software onto a computer or the operation of the software
on that computer.

#### Infringement

Liability for patent infringement arises when a party “without authority
makes, uses, offers to sell, or sells any patented invention, within the
United States or imports into the United States any patented invention
during the term of the patent therefor, infringes the patent.”[^usa_138] The
Patent Act also recognizes liability for inducing infringement.[^usa_139]

A patent that is asserted in an infringement action is presumed to be
valid,[^usa_140] and at present such validity may only be overcome by clear
and convincing evidence of invalidity. This clear and convincing
evidence standard is higher than the preponderance of the evidence
standard used by patent examiners at the time of examination even if the
evidence supporting invalidity was not before the examiner at the time
of examination.

Remedies for patent infringement include injunctive relief, monetary
damages in the form of a reasonable royalty, and attorney’s fees and
costs of court.[^usa_141] Where infringement is found to be willful the
court may award treble damages.[^usa_142] Damages for patent infringement
only begin to accrue when a party has been placed on notice of their
infringement. While such notice may be provided by marking the goods for
patents, such marking rarely occurs with respect to software.
Consequently, notice of infringement of patents related to software
usually only arises upon the giving of written notice to the
infringer.[^usa_143]

### Other matters of law

#### Representations, warranties and disclaimers

Although there is a legal distinction between a representation (a fact
that is true at the time of the making of an agreement) and a warranty
(a fact that is true at the time of the making of an agreement and
throughout the term of the agreement unless otherwise limited), U.S.
courts rarely draw such a distinction except in determining the remedy
(revocation for a breach of a representation versus money damages for
breach of a warranty). A representation or warranty constitutes an
assumption of risk on the part of the party making the representation or
warranty. As such, most such representations and warranties must be
expressly stated within the license agreement. However, some warranties
may be implied. Those may include an implied warranty of title (i.e.,
the licensor holds good title to the copyright or patent being license),
of non-infringement (i.e., the licensing of the copyright or patent will
not constitute an infringing act on the part of the licensee with
respect to a third party’s copyright or patent), of merchantability
(i.e., the goods must reasonably conform to an ordinary buyer’s
expectations) and of fitness for a particular purpose (i.e., the goods
are held out by the seller to address a specific purpose). Most
licensors will include a disclaimer of any and all such implied
warranties in order to limit their exposure to only those express
warranties to which they have agreed, and such disclaimers are generally
held valid under principles of contract law. You will often see such
disclaimers stated in all capital letters or bold print; this is
commonly done to conform to the safe harbor provisions of laws
pertaining to warranties, including the Uniform Commercial Code and the
Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act.[^usa_144]

#### Liability and limitation

Under principles of contract law parties may agree to limit the scope of
liability that may be imposed on a party under a license agreement, and
such limitations are generally held to be valid.

#### Export control

Although there are numerous other laws that are applicable to the
licensing of software, we only make mention of one here — export
control. U.S. law prohibits the exporting of software incorporating
cryptographic code except under a license issued by the Bureau of
Industry and Security.[^usa_145] Obligations and liability under the statute
extend beyond the original distributor to any downstream party that
redistributes the software. As a consequence, most original distributors
include in their license a notice of such obligations and liability.

## Analysis of FOSS under United States law

Rights in FOSS under copyright, patent, and trademark law and the
enforcement of such rights does not differ from other forms of
licensing. The principle question to be addressed in each instance,
particularly with respect to the exercise of rights granted under the
FOSS license is whether any of such rights are subject to conditions.
Absent such conditions applicable to the exercise of the right in
question, such FOSS licenses will be interpreted exclusively under
principles of contract law, and as a consequence, injunctive relief (the
most valuable tool available to a FOSS licensor) is likely to be
unavailable. Consequently, when considering the selection and
enforcement of a FOSS license, the licensor will want to give due
consideration as to whether a court would likely find a condition
limiting the exercise of such right (e.g., the obligations imposed by
the GNU General Public License (GPL) on any party distributing code
licensed under the GPL) or no such condition (e.g., arguably the
Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) and MIT licenses impose no such
conditions).

## FOSS cases in the United States

There have been few cases in the U.S. that have addressed the
enforcement of free and open source licenses. Many of the so-called free
and open source cases have dealt primarily with trademark issues.

### Jacobsen v. Katzer

*Jacobsen v. Katzer*[^usa_146] is undoubtedly the most important of the
cases addressing free and open source software in the U.S. At issue was
the provision of the Artistic license that requires licensees to include
both copyright notices and a tracking of modifications in derivative
works.

Citing to Nimmer in support of enforcement of the license the court
stated: “An express (or possibly an implied) condition that a licensee
must affix a proper copyright notice to all copies of the work that he
causes to be published will render a publication devoid of such notice
without authority from the licensor and therefore, an infringing
act.”[^usa_147]

In broad language that would support most, if not all, open source
licenses the court stated:

> Copyright holders who engage in open source licensing have the right
> to control the modification and distribution of copyrighted material…
> Copyright licenses are designed to support the right to exclude; money
> damages alone do not support or enforce that right. The choice to
> exact consideration in the form of compliance with the open source
> requirements of disclosure and explanation of changes, rather than as
> a dollar-denominated fee, is entitled to no less legal recognition.
> Indeed, because a calculation of damages is inherently speculative,
> these types of license restrictions might well be rendered meaningless
> absent the ability to enforce through injunctive relief.
>
> —  Jacobsen 535 F.3d at 1381 (2008).

Although the Jacobsen case later settled, this Federal Circuit ruling
clearly established the enforceability of free and open source licenses
containing at least one condition limiting a licensee’s right to
exercise one or more rights granted under a copyright license.

### Wallace v. International Business Machines Corp.

Although a bit of an odd case and one not directly related to the
enforcement of a free and open source license, *Wallace v. IBM*[^usa_148] is
worth mentioning because of the antitrust (anti-competition) issue
raised by the plaintiff, Mr. Wallace, i.e., that the distribution of
free and open source software at no cost constitutes illegal price
fixing within the terms of U.S. antitrust law. The court found no such
price fixing or restraint and found the GPL to be “a cooperative
agreement that facilitates production of new derivative works, and
agreements that yield new products that would not arise through
unilateral action are lawful.”[^usa_149]
