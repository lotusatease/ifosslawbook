## Body of Law

Software, including computer programs, is protected as copyrightable
work under the Copyright Act (“the Act”) of Korea. Special provisions in
Articles 101-2 through 101-7 of the Act address the protection of such
programs. Previously, the Protection Act of Computer Programs addressed
the safeguarding of computer programs until it was abolished and
absorbed into the Act in 2009.[^korea_1]

Under Korean law, international treaties, to which Korea is a party, are
self-executing, meaning that no additional legislation is necessary to
give effect to the treaty under domestic law. This means that
international treaties addressing copyrights or intellectual property
rights, such as the Berne Convention (effective in Korea as of 21 August
1996), the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property
Rights ("TRIPS") (effective in Korea as of 1 July 1996) and the World
Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty ("WCT") (effective
in Korea as of 24 June 2004), are given the same weight and effect as
domestic law. As recently as 2012, Korea entered into Free Trade
Agreements (“FTA”) with the U.S. and the E.U., which have been in effect
since 15 March, 2012 and 1 July, 2011 respectively. The Act has been
revised to provide a wider range of protection for the software in
range, remedies, technical protection measures, etc.

## Object of Protection

According to the Act, ‘computer program’ means a work reduced to
writing, composed of orders and directions, used in a device with
information processing capability with the purpose of obtaining a
specific result.[^korea_2] In other words, the program should 1) be
functioning on a device capable of processing, controlling, and storing,
2) be able to perform meaningful work, 3) have at least two sets of
instructions and orders, and 4) be expressed in code (and not just exist
as an idea).[^korea_3] Under the laws of Korea, the term ‘software’ has a
broader meaning than just a computer program; it includes flow charts,
system architecture and user manuals, which are afforded legal
protection through the general provisions of the Act. Databases, while
not included in the definition of ‘computer program,’ are protected
separately under specific provisions contained in Articles 91 through
Article 98 of the Act. The Supreme Court of Korea has stated that to be
an author of a computer program, some level of creativity is required,
just as it is required for other literary works under the Act. It
declared that while the work does not need to be completely original or
novel, the author must have expressed his/her own thoughts or emotions
to the extent that his/her work is distinguishable from the work of
another.[^korea_4] The Act, however, excludes programming languages
(characters, symbols and their systems as means of expressing programs),
syntax (special agreement on the usage of the programming language in a
specific program) and algorithms (combination methods of instructions
and commands in program) from protection.[^korea_5]

## Authors

### Definition of Author

The general provisions of the Act applicable to authors of other type of
literary works extends to the authors of computer programs: an author is
a person who has created a work,[^korea_6] and becomes the holder of exclusive
and moral rights to such work.[^korea_7] Under the Berne Convention,
copyrights are composed of moral and exclusive rights. Moral rights are
the author’s right to have the work published, the right to indicate
his/her name on the work, and the right to preserve the integrity of the
content, format, and title of the work.An author automatically becomes
the copyright holder upon the creation of a work since the Act does not
require any registration procedures or other types of formalities for an
author to be recognized as a copyright holder.[^korea_8]

### Authors of Work Made for Hire

In contrast, under the laws of Korea, an employer who engages an
employee for a work made for hire (sometimes referred to as work for
hire or WFH) will be treated as the author of the work, and not just the
holder of moral and exclusive rights.[^korea_9] Here, an employer may refer to
a juristic person, legal entity, an organization, etc. [^korea_10]

For a work to be recognized as a work made for hire, the following
conditions must be satisfied: a work has to be made (i) under the
supervision of an employer (ii) by an employee working for the employer
(iii) during performance of his or her duties, and (iv) the work must be
published under the name of the employer.[^korea_11] In instances where
computer programs are work made for hire, employers do not need to meet
the fourth prong of the test as publication would be counter to the
purpose of keeping confidential trade secrets.[^korea_12] However, even in the
case where all of the above conditions are satisfied, if an employment
contract or the employer’s internal regulation states otherwise,[^korea_13]
the person who created the work may become the author of the work.

In Korea, many programs used by companies are developed on a contract
basis[^korea_14] meaning that a commissioning party can agree to pay
remuneration in exchange for work produced by a commissioned party (also
known as the developing party) to create certain programs. When the
conditions for work made for hire are not met in the course of
performance of the contract, the developing party, as the author, may
transfer exclusive rights to the party who ordered the work by an
agreement of assignment; however, the moral rights still belong to the
developing party as these rights are alienable from the author.
Therefore, it is important to analyze whether a commissioned work may be
recognized as a work made for hire as this determines the rightful
holder of moral rights. With regard to this issue, the courts have held
that the doctrine of work made for hire is usually not applicable to
most commissioned work. Generally, the commissioning party will not be
considered the author in a customary computer program development
contract. However, when the commission party is the sole investor,
planner, and publisher of the ordered work, and the commissioning party
borrows only the commissioned party’s human resources, the work will be
recognized as a work made for hire of the party who ordered the
work.[^korea_15] In other words, in cases where the contribution of the entity
who ordered the work is dominant (while the developer has little
discretion), the ordering entity is the sole financer of the program,
and the work is developed to benefit only the commissioning party, the
program will be recognized as a work made for hire, as described in the
above.

### Joint Authors

In case of a joint authorship, an author may not exercise the exclusive
or moral rights without the unanimous agreement of all the copyright
holders. However, a copyright holder may not discourage the other
copyright holders from reaching an agreement on exercise of the
copyright or unreasonably withhold his/her consent in bad faith.[^korea_16]
Authors of a joint work may designate a representative amongst them to
exercise their copyrights, with the caveat that any limitations imposed
on the authority of such representative should not take precedence over
a bona fide third party.[^korea_17] With respect to the exclusive rights of a
joint authorship, an author cannot transfer, assign or pledge his/her
share of the exclusive rights without the consent of the remaining
authors. Any profit accruing from the exploitation of a joint work will
be apportioned among the authors according to the respective shares of
each author, unless otherwise stipulated. In such cases, the share of
each author shall be deemed equal unless otherwise clearly
specified.[^korea_18]

## Exclusive rights

According to the Act, the author of a program has exclusive rights to
reproduce,[^korea_19] transmit or broadcast the work in public,[^korea_20] and to
distribute,[^korea_21] lease, rent,[^korea_22] or produce derivative works[^korea_23].
Characteristics worth noting are as follows. Based on the revision of
the Act in 2011, which reflected the Korea-United States FTA, temporary
reproduction was included in concept of a reproduction. The right of
public transmission, which includes the pre-existing notion of rights of
broadcasting and transferring, was introduced by the amendment of the
Act in 2006. It was through this amendment that the Act was extended to
include the right of transmission of a work or database or right of
making such work or database available to the public via wire or
wireless communication. As a result, uploading digital information of a
work on the internet is now prohibited as a violation of right of public
transmission. The right of distribution is only applicable to
distribution in tangible media. The Court has declared that ‘a user’s
connecting to a certain server to save a specific digital file in a
shared folder to enable other users to download shall not be considered
a distribution and that transferring a work or a copy only in a tangible
media shall be construed as distribution.[^korea_24] The author’s leasing
rights only applies when a computer program is leased for profit; the
right to create derivative works means a right to create a new work
based on the work by means of translation, modification, alteration,
etc. of original work; and the right to make compilations falls under
the right of reproduction.[^korea_25]

## Exceptions to the Exclusive Rights

In relation to use of computer programs, there are several special
exceptions to exclusive rights under the Act. For example, a user of a
computer program may temporarily reproduce such program in a computer
without consent of the exclusive right holder to the extent deemed
necessary for the purpose of efficient information processing.[^korea_26]
Additionally, a user may reproduce a program to check the ideas or
principles underlying such program for the purpose of research, study,
or testing without the consent of the copyright holder and may
temporarily reproduce a program for the purpose of maintenance and
repair of such program. [^korea_27] Reverse engineering is the copying or
modifying of a computer program copyright code in order to obtain
information necessary for interoperability of independently created
computer programs with other computer programs.[^korea_28] The Act allows
limited reverse engineering in cases where it is necessary to obtain
information for the compatibility of such program with other program,
provided that a user cannot obtain said information through an
alternative source or method. A user may not transmit information
obtained by reverse engineering to a third party other than for the
purpose of establishing or testing compatibility. Furthermore, the user
should not use the information obtained during reverse engineering for
developing, producing, or selling substantially similar programs in
infringement of the copyright of the program.[^korea_29] In regard to the
principle of exhaustion, once the original work or its copy has been
sold with the copyright holder’s express intention to do so, (excluding
the holder of moral right, since the moral right is inalienable while
exclusive right is not), the right of distribution by the copyright
holder is exhausted.[^korea_30] Therefore, a buyer may distribute the original
work or its copy without any permission from the holder of exclusive
right. However, it is not clear under the laws of Korea whether the
principle of exhaustion applies to intangible digital works purchased
through on-line networks as there are no current statutes or court
precedents that address this issue.

## Moral Rights

An author’s moral rights belong exclusively to the author,[^korea_31] and
these rights cannot be assigned or transferred. Moral rights are the
author’s right to publish the work, the right of attribution, and the
right to preserve the integrity of the content, format, and title of the
work. Exercising such rights through a proxy or an agent is possible,
but only to the extent that it does not substantially infringe upon the
author’s moral rights.[^korea_32] A person who violates an author’s moral
rights will be subject to imprisonment for no more than three years or
be charged with a fine not exceeding 30 million won, or both.[^korea_33]
Expression of an author’s intention on his or her right to the integrity
of the work may be delivered by implied consent.[^korea_34] A user may modify
a computer program without consent of the copyright holder, only to the
extent such modification is necessary to make the program which is
designed for a specific computer available for other computers or to the
extent such modification is necessary for efficiency of the specific
computer.[^korea_35] The right of attribution and the right of publication is
governed by the general provisions of the Act. In cases where authors
and copyright holders of unpublished work are not one in the same, and
these authors, rather than the copyright holders, assign their exclusive
rights to another person or grant the person the right to use or
exclusively issue it, the authors will be deemed to have consented to
its publication.[^korea_36] If derivative or compilation work made with the
consent of the original author has been published, the original work
will be deemed to have been published.[^korea_37]

## Terms of Protection

The 2011 amended version of the Act, effective as of 1 July 2013,
provides that the author’s exclusive rights to a program will be
effective for the author’s life time plus seventy years after the death
of the author.[^korea_38] The exclusive rights for work made for hire
continues to exist for a period of 70 years after it has been
published.[^korea_39] The exclusive rights for a work with no author’s name or
second name continues to exist for a period of 70 years after it has
been published.[^korea_40] The exclusive rights to a joint work continues to
exist for a period of seventy years after the death of the last
surviving author,[^korea_41] and the exclusive right for derivative works is
protected independently from the original work, under the Act, for the
lifetime of the author of derivative works plus seventy years after the
death of such author. The protection period of the exclusive rights
starts from the year after the author’s death or its publication,[^korea_42]
since it may be difficult ascertain the exact dates of the author’s
death, creation or publication.

## Copyright Assignment

### Assignment of Exclusive Rights

Exclusive rights may be assigned in whole or in part.[^korea_43] Each of the
exclusive rights, such as right of reproduction, right of public
transmission, etc., may be assigned as a whole or in piecemeal.
Additional constraints such as geographic limitations may be added. For
example, the right of reproduction may only be available in the U.S.
When the exclusive rights of a program are assigned as a whole, the
right to make a derivative work will be presumed to have been included,
unless otherwise stipulated.[^korea_44] The exclusive right holder may grant
permission to use the work instead of transferring the exclusive right
by assignment.[^korea_45] When it is uncertain whether the author assigned the
exclusive rights or granted mere permission to use, the exclusive rights
will remain with the author, according to the Supreme Court’s
decision.[^korea_46] According to Article 105 (1) of the Act, copyrights can
be held in trust. Under the Trust Act, if the trustor creates a valid
express trust, the trustee should manage and dispose of the trust corpus
in the interest of the beneficiary or in the stated interests of the
trust. Under the trust agreement, ownership of the trust property is
completely transferred from the trustor to the trustee; and the trustee
has all of the rights to the trust property, including the right to file
a lawsuit. Therefore, the trustor is prohibited from instituting any
claims for compensatory damages based on the copyrights in the trust
property.[^korea_47] Under Article 105(2) of the Act only those organizations
satisfying the following criteria are permitted to carry out copyright
trust services: (i) the organization must be comprised of holders of
copyrights (or other rights protected under the Copyright Act) to the
trust property; (ii) the organization must be not for profit; and (iii)
the organization must possess the capability to conduct the collection
and distribution of royalties.

### Assignment of Moral Rights

Since the author’s moral rights are inalienable and not
transferable,[^korea_48] moral rights exhaust at the author’s death. No
special provisions under the Act limit the moral rights of computer
programs, as such, moral rights for computer programs are recognized
like other copyrighted works. Due to its inalienability, an author’s
moral rights cannot be held in trust.[^korea_49]

## Special Measures

### Civil Remedies

If a copyright holder’s work is infringed, the copyright holder may file
an application for a cease-and-desist order against the infringer. The
copyright holder or holder of other rights under the Act may request an
injunction for such infringement provided that such infringement
continues, regardless of the infringer’s intention or negligent
conduct.[^korea_50] The copyright holder may file a petition to a court to
take preventive measures or to provide a security for compensation for
damages against a potential infringer of his or her exclusive rights.
The court may issue a preliminary injunction to temporarily suspend the
infringement, to seize the objects made by the act of infringement, or
to take other necessary measures on behalf of the plaintiff whose
copyright is being infringed.[^korea_51] The copyright holder' may also seek
injunctive relief, which may be granted upon showing the existence of
the claims to be preserved and the need to preserve such claims. The
copyright holder’s right to apply for a cease-and-desist order and right
to request preventive measures constitute the existence of such claims.
A pledge of security may not be required to grant injunctive
relief.[^korea_52]. Moreover, the copyright holder has the right to request
actual damages for monetary loss or non-economic damages, such as mental
or emotional damage, against the infringer.[^korea_53] The copyright holder
may claim, taking into account the difficulty of proving the amount of
damages, either (1) the amount of profit the infringer gained through
infringement, or (2) the amount corresponding to the revenues that would
have been acquired by the copyright holder by exercising his or her
copyright in normal course of business.[^korea_54] Moreover, due to revision
of the Act to reflect the Korea-US FTA, the copyright holder may claim
statutory damages, instead of actual damages, if the copyright holder
had registered his/her copyright prior to exercise of the claim of
statutory damages.[^korea_55] In case the copyright holder fails to prove the
infringer’s intentional conduct or negligence or the three year period
for statute of limitations has expired, the copyright holder may claim
restitution for unjust enrichment pursuant to the Civil Act of Korea.
When an author’s moral rights (such as the right to decide when and how
to publish a work—which may be done anonymously or pseudonymously—the
right of attribution, or right to the integrity of the work) are
infringed, the author may claim damages arising from such infringements
under Article 751 of the Civil Act of Korea. The court has declared that
“although no express law exists, it is natural that copyright holder can
claim damages for the infringement of his or her moral right which is
inalienable in its nature.[^korea_56]" In these situations, there is a
rebuttable presumption that the copyright holder suffered damages,
mentally or emotionally, as well as damages to reputation.[^korea_57] The
copyright holder may request to take measures to restore his/her
reputation in cases of defamation. In the event the moral rights are
infringed or the dignity of the author has been damaged, the damaged
party may request restoration of his or her reputation as well as
monetary damages.[^korea_58] The Act also has separate provisions that apply
to the infringement of moral rights after an author’s death. This
provision allows the author’s bereaved family or executor of his or her
will to demand preventive measures, provision of security for damages,
or restoration of the author’s reputation.[^korea_59]

### Joint Works

In the event there are concerns that the copyright of a joint work might
be infringed, each joint author is entitled to seek preventive measures
or a cease-and-desist order under Article 123 of the Act. If the
exclusive rights are infringed, each of the holders of exclusive rights
may claim monetary damages in proportion to his or her share of
copyright under Article 125 of the Act. When the infringement of moral
rights concerns all the joint authors, the copyright holders must act in
unison to seek reparation. However, the amount of damages sought by each
author is in his/her discretion.[^korea_60] In cases where moral rights of
just one of the joint authors are infringed, each author may act
independently of the others when filing suit.

### Collective Works

When there are concerns as to whether copyrights of collective works
will be infringed or when copyrights of collective works are actually
infringed, each copyright holder may respectively claim damages or seek
prohibitive and preventive measures, or cease-and-desist orders for the
works created by him or herself.

### Derivative Works

The courts[^korea_61] have held that the copyright of derivative computer
program belongs to the author of the derivative computer program
regardless of whether the copyright holder of the original work gave
his/her consent for use of the original in the derivative work. The
author of the derivative work may claim damages when the derivative
work’s copyright is infringed. However, a copyright holder of a
derivative work may not use the derivative work without consent of the
copyright holder of the original work.

### Criminal Sanctions

Article 136 of the Act stipulates that copyright infringers are subject
to criminal punishment. Before the inclusion of the Korea-USA FTA into
the Act, Article 140 provided that a copyright infringer may not be
criminally punished without a complaint by the copyright holder except
in circumstances where infringements were committed habitually *and*
with profit-making motives (*emphasis added*). With the passage of the
Korea-USA FTA, the Act’s exception clause was broadened to allow
criminal prosecution of those who were habitual infringers *or*
infringers who were profit-motivated ('emphasis added").[^korea_62] It is
possible that this broadened exception clause subjects more infringers
to criminal sanctions as compared to the previous version of the Act.

## Unprotected Software and Public Domain Software

Works with expired copyright protection terms, works without a copyright
holder, or works with express waivers from copyright holder are not be
protected under the Act. In contrast, though Free and Open Source
Software (“FOSS”) makes available its source code for public use, it is
not unprotected software or public domain software as defined under the
Act.

## Analysis of FOSS under Korean Law

### Copyright

The process of concluding FOSS licenses differs from that of other
copyrighted works. Under Korean law, a FOSS license agreement is treated
much like a contract because of the similarities between the two. First,
the all-important intent to form a contract exists between the two
parties. The offeror intends the offeree to use the copyrighted work by
granting the offeree the permission to use the work; the offeree often
manifests his/her intent to accept through some action that signifies
his/her acceptance. Second, a FOSS license explicitly states the
material conditions for using the copyrighted work. For the reasons
mentioned above, the FOSS license agreement is binding and enforceable
under Korean law as a contract. Although people might have the mistaken
belief that authors of FOSS have waived their rights because of the free
public availability of FOSS, from the legal perspective, the authors
continue to hold their valid copyrights in FOSS, which are protected
under the relevant laws while simultaneously allowing users the right to
use the FOSS under certain conditions. The development environment of
FOSS is radically different than the environment in which commercial
proprietary software is developed. While several program developers may
collaborate at the same time to create the first version of FOSS, FOSS
is usually developed by successive combinations of derivative works
taken from preceding derivative works based on its original work.
Important legal issues concerning FOSS are: who holds the copyrights,
what is the object of copyright protection, and how copyright holders
can enforce their rights emanating from the copyrights. All of which are
reviewed in detail as follows:

### Qualification of FOSS

Many users are expected to use, copy, modify, and redistribute FOSS
after the creation of the first version. The works made during the
process are classified into one of three categories: joint works,
collective works, or derivative works. Joint work is created when two or
more program developers collaborate, with the intention that their
individual contributions be merged into one. Program developers need not
work on the program contemporaneously in order to be considered joint
work. Collective work is when each developer’s contribution can be used
separately and independently. Derivative work is when a developer
modifies the pre-existing FOSS with significant variations while
maintaining substantial similarities.[^korea_63]

### Rights of Joint Authors

Since the exclusive rights to a joint work must be exercised with the
unanimous agreement of all the exclusive rights holders, it becomes more
significantly harder to reach absolute consensus when many developers
are involved. To solve this conundrum, copyleft FOSS licenses contain
clauses that make it mandatory for each contributor (developer) to allow
his or her contribution to be freely available to the public for copy,
modification and redistribution. Moreover, in accordance with the
principle of private autonomy, each contributor may agree in advance to
make freely available his/her contribution even before he/she creates
the code in accordance with the license agreement, which shall be
effective under the laws of Korea.

### Rights of Authors of Collective Works

The defining characteristic of a collective work is that each author’s
contribution can be separated into discrete parts. As such, each author
of a collective work may, without the other authors’ permission, assign
his or her exclusive rights to another or permit others to use his/her
own creation.

### Rights of Copyright Holders of Derivative Works

The Korean Supreme Court held that creator of the derivative work of a
computer program holds the copyrights to the derivative work, whether or
not the copyright holder of the original work gave his/her consent to
use the original work in the derivative one.[^korea_64] Therefore, copyrights
for the derived programs based on General Public Licensed ("GPL’d")
software belong to the developer of the derivative work, to the extent
that it is his/her own creation under the laws of Korea.[^korea_65] When an
original work and its derivative are inseparable, a question arises of
whether the consent of all authors is needed in order to modify or
change the inseparable work. To deal with this issue, Article 6 of
General Public License ("GPL") 2.0 states that recipients of each
derivative work automatically receive a license from the original
licensor to use, copy, distribute or modify such derivative work. Also,
Article 2 of Apache 2.0 and Article 2.1 of the Mozilla Public License
(“MPL”) 2.0 state that each contributor gives users permission to use
the work. All of the previously cited license clauses are valid under
Korean law. Copyleft clauses in FOSS licenses may be a point of
controversy when it comes to protecting derivative works or authors of
derivative works under Korean law. Copyleft clauses obligate the source
code of derivative works to be distributed under the same license as the
original work, which results in limiting the exercise of the copyright
by the copyright holder of the derivative works. However, under Apache
and Berkeley Software Distribution (“BSD”) licenses, which do not
require the authors of the derivative works to disclose the source code
of the modified programs, the copyrights of the authors of the
derivative works are protected as provided in the Act. Since Korean law
acknowledges the principle of private autonomy, except for certain
rights that cannot be transferred or waived under the compulsory
provisions, exercise of copyrights can be limited in accordance with a
license agreement under the doctrine. For example, copyleft clauses may
limit the moral right of a copyright holder of a derivative work by
stipulating the method and time of publication of the work or by
allowing free modification of the work by the public. However, an author
is entitled to determine how to exercise his/her moral rights under the
principle of private autonomy as long as he/she does not transfer
his/her moral rights. Therefore, copyleft clauses are valid under Korean
law if it falls within the previously described bounds of conduct. If an
author of the derivative work does not fulfill his or her obligations
under the license and argues that the copyleft clause is unfair and thus
void under the Korean law, GPL auto-termination clauses may intervene by
prohibiting the author of the derivative work from using the original
work. While it’s undecided if this would be a winning argument in court,
the author of a derivative work most likely will not benefit from
arguing that copyleft clauses are void.

### The Assignment of Copyrights

The same principle on the assignment of copyrights applies to computer
programs. Copyrights of software can also be held in trust; however, it
is not frequently practiced in Korea. When FOSS is made as a work for
hire, the employer becomes the author of the FOSS by operation of the
Act and thus becomes the holder of exclusive and moral rights.[^korea_66] In
such instances, the employer may exercise its copyrights under the terms
and conditions of a FOSS license.

## Moral Rights

Because most FOSS licenses allow liberal modifications to FOSS, a major
legal issue is whether these modifications will severely infringe upon
the author’s right to the integrity of the work. Creating a derivative
work inevitably causes limitations on the exercise of the original
author’s right to the integrity of the work since the derivative work is
a new one that substantially modifies the original work. However, the
author’s right to the integrity of the work can also be waived under the
doctrine of private autonomy. When a copyright holder allows its
downstream users to create derivative works, the copyright holder may
dictate the parameters within which the integrity of the content should
be maintained. Therefore, by executing a license agreement, the original
author may limit his or her moral right to maintain the integrity of the
work by allowing free and substantial modifications of the original work
without running afoul Korean law. There is a caveat to the original
author’s waiver of the right: when a user of FOSS modifies the original
work in a manner against the original author’s purpose of creation,
which renders the author’s intention suspicious, and is detrimental to
the honor or reputation of the original author, infringement of the
author’s moral rights shall still be recognized, regardless of the
effectiveness of the original author’s waiver of the right to the
integrity of the work under the terms of a license.

## Enforcing FOSS Licenses

Various bodies of law such as Korean contract law, the Copyright Act,
criminal law, etc. should be considered simultaneously in order to
determine whether FOSS license agreements are binding and enforceable.

### Contracting Parties

Unlike general license agreements, FOSS license agreements may involve
several authors of the original work or derivative works. Assuming that
an agreement is concluded, once FOSS is downloaded and used, identifying
the contracting parties is an issue. In order to legitimately use FOSS
as an end user at the end of development chain, the end user must
receive permission from all legitimate copyright holders throughout the
entire development and modification process of FOSS. When FOSS is
distributed directly from the copyright holder of the original FOSS (the
“Original Copyright Holder”), the contracting parties of the FOSS
license agreement are the Original Copyright Holder and the recipient of
the software. However, if the recipient of FOSS redistributes the
software to a third party (the “Redistributor”) without making any
modifications, different opinions may arise on whether the Redistributor
becomes either a contracting party or an agent of the Original Copyright
Holder who is the contracting party. It is reasonable to recognize that
the intent of the distributor is to distribute the software in his or
her own capacity within the scope of his or her permitted use, instead
of distributing as the copyright holder’s agent, unless it was
explicitly otherwise expressed. For example, when a distributor of
non-copyleft licensed original software distributes that software under
a different license, the effect of the distribution is not binding on
the author of FOSS because he/she never agreed to the different license.
Therefore, the contracting parties of such distribution should be the
distributor and the downstream recipient.[^korea_67] Naturally, when a person
who modified a program distributes the modified software, he/she would
be the contracting party.[^korea_68]

### The Validity of FOSS Licenses

#### Contractual Relationship

Providing FOSS for free gives it the simultaneous status as a gift under
the Korean Civil Act as well as a copyrightable work license agreement
under the Act.[^korea_69] An offer and acceptance are required to form a
legally binding contract. Under the current legal framework, the
distribution of FOSS constitutes an offer.[^korea_70] Though the licensees may
be numerous and unspecified, FOSS license agreements may be considered
contracts as long as they contain material terms that are specific and
definitive. The Court has held that ‘offer should be specific and
definitive to such an extent as to establish an agreement by its
corresponding acceptance; the offer should include information which
could determine the contents of the agreement.’[^korea_71] Most FOSS licenses
present specific and definitive terms and conditions which could
determine the contents of the agreement in order to use the
corresponding FOSS program. In order for a contract to come into
existence, an offer and its corresponding acceptance should be present,
and, in principle, the offeree should notify the offerror of his/her
acceptance. Practically speaking, no means exist for a licensee of FOSS
to notify anyone of his/her acceptance. Where no notice of acceptance is
required for a contract to be validly executed, whether through the
offeror’s explicit permission or because of trade custom practice, the
contract will come into existence upon the occurrence of an event, which
may be construed as a declaration of the intention to accept.[^korea_72] Under
a FOSS license agreement, the licensee does not need to give a notice of
acceptance to the licensor. Instead, the licensee’s download of
FOSS[^korea_73] or the modification or distribution of the program constitutes
acceptance[^korea_74]. Experts are divided as to which of these events
actually qualify as the formal acceptance. Further, FOSS licenses are
regarded as standardized contract terms as defined under the Act on the
Regulation of Terms and Conditions. Standardized contract terms means
the contents of a contract that a party prepares in a specific form in
advance in order to enter into a contract with unspecified multiple
parties regardless of their name, type, or scope.[^korea_75]

### No Warranty

#### Limitation on ‘no warranty clause’ under the Civil Act

License agreements such as GPL, etc. provide that any copyright holder,
or any other party who may modify or redistribute the program
(“Contributors”) may disclaim warranties against any defects of the FOSS
program. In other words, Contributors are not liable for any damages
arising out of defects of the program, even if the holder or other party
was aware that the defects may have existed. According to Article 559 of
the Korean Civil Act, \`a donor shall not be liable for any defect or
deficiency in the thing or right which forms the subject of his or her
gift; provided, that this shall not apply to cases where he/she was
aware of such defect or deficiency and has nevertheless failed to inform
the donee thereof.’ The aforementioned article on the Korean Civil Act
seems to conflict with the FOSS license no-warranties clauses. However,
the terms of no-warranty clauses of FOSS license agreement such as GPL,
which includes ‘possibility of such defects,’ does not extend to cases
where copyright holder are fully aware of the defects. In other words,
when the copyright does not disclose a known defect or deficiency to a
recipient, the copyright holder will be liable for damages under the
Korean Civil Act. No-warranty clauses will be ineffective in these
situations. However, when the copyright holders only recognize the
possibility of defects, without actual knowledge of such defect or
deficiency, which is threshold conditions under the Korean Civil Act,
the copyright holders can effectively disclaim its warranties.[^korea_76]

#### Under the Act on the Regulation of Standardized Contracts

According to Article 7 of the Act on the Regulation of Standardized
Contracts,[^korea_77] the standardized contract terms that concern the
liability of contracting parties that fall under any of the following
subparagraphs will be null and void: 1) a clause that exempts a business
operator (a party to a contract who offers standard business terms to
the opposing parties as the content of the contract), its agents, or its
employees from liability arising from intentional conduct or gross
negligence; 2) a clause which limits the extent of damages payable by
the business operator, in circumstances without objective justifiable
cause; 3) a clause which excludes or limits the warranty liability of a
company in situations without objective justifiable cause.[^korea_78] The
no-warranty clauses of the FOSS license agreements as in GPL, constitute
standard business terms since a contracting party prepares such clauses
in a specific form in advance in order to enter into a contract with
unspecified multiple contracting parties. Since FOSS is provided for
free, which could be seen as an “objective justifiable cause” under
subparagraphs 2) and 3), a no- warranty clause would apply and thus
would not be null and void. However, in the event that disclaimer
clauses are applied to software providers who acted with intention or
gross negligence, the clause would be null and void under the above
referenced paragraph 1). In other words, if the licensor was aware of
the defect of the software or should have been aware of the defect but
for the gross negligence of the licensor, the licensor is liable for
damages pursuant to Article 559 of the Korean Civil Act. If the
licensor’s gross negligence or intentional conduct is proven, the
licensee is entitled to seek liabilities from the licensor pursuant to
Article 7 of the Act on the Regulation of Terms and Conditions.[^korea_79]
However, if the licensee under the GPL 2.0 seeks liabilities from the
licensor claiming that the no-warranty clause is null and void, then the
licensor may claim that the license agreement was automatically
terminated because the licensee copied or distributed FOSS program
except as expressly provided under GPL 2.0 and was in breach of a
no-warranty clause. When a commercial distributor provides warranties
for a FOSS in exchange for a fee, no warranties in the original FOSS
license agreement will be deemed to have been modified between the
commercial distributor and the end user, especially when these
warranties did not exist in the original license agreement. Therefore,
the distributor should be liable under the additional contractual
obligations as a contracting party. Moreover, to the extent the scope of
warranty under such agreement is narrower than the scope specified in
the compulsory provisions of relevant laws, the warranties scope
specified in the applicable law will apply.

#### Limitation under the Product Liability Act

Under the Korea Product Liability Act, ‘product’ means all movable
goods, industrially manufactured or processed, including movable goods
that is a part of another immovable or movable good. Because of the
perceived intangible nature of a computer program, whether a ‘computer
program’ is a product is a hotly contested issue.[^korea_80] According to
Article 3 of the Korea Product Liability Act, a manufacturer who
distributes software contained or embedded in tangible storage means or
devices will be liable for damages, death, personal injuries, or
property damage (this category excludes the damage to the defective
product) that a person suffers as a result of a product defect, arising
from defects in manufacturing, defects of design, or inadequate warnings
on the product.[^korea_81] Any special agreement intended to exclude or limit
the liabilities for damage in violation of the Product Liability Act
will be null and void, provided that this will not apply to cases where
a person who purchased a defective product to be used solely for his/her
own business and entered into a special agreement to limit or exclude
liabilities for damages incurred to his business property.[^korea_82] In order
to apply the Product Liability Act to a FOSS distributor, the
distributor should be a manufacturer, which the Product Liability Act
defines as a person who is engaged in the business of manufacturing,
processing, or importing any product.[^korea_83] If a company creates a FOSS
program embedded in a device or devices meant for its own consumption,
the liability exemption clause of the FOSS license may be valid under
Article 6 of the Act. Therefore, in practice, product liability on FOSS
would not often recognized.[^korea_84]

## The Copyleft Principle

### Principle

Strong copyleft clauses included in GPL 2.0 or 3.0, which obligate
downstream users to distribute the source code of work based on the
original program of the same copyleft license, may conflict with the
Copyright Act and the Trade Secret Protection Act. The former
acknowledges the independent copyrights of authors of derivative works
while the latter protects trade secrets.

### The Validity of Copyleft Clause

As mentioned above, copyleft clauses are valid under Korean law since
the principle of private autonomy is applied to the exercise of
copyright. However, copyleft clauses may conflict with the Trade Secret
Protection Act. The Trade Secret Protection Act defines ‘trade secret’
as information (including production and sales methods, useful technical
or business information for business activity), that is not publicly
known and of which is the subject of considerable effort to maintain the
secrecy and independent economic value. Though trade secrets are
protected under the Trade Secret Protection Act, many licenses,
including GPL, require disclosure of the original source code for
derivative programs and thus may be in conflict with the Trade Secret
Protection Act.. The Korean Supreme Court has held that when the person
who modifies FOSS becomes the author of the derivative work by meeting
the legal standard set forth by the courts, the original source code of
the derivative work is still considered a trade secret provided that it
remains unpublished, retains its independent economic value, and is kept
confidential through the considerable effort of the trade secret holder.
Although the author of derivative work may be liable for damages to the
original author because the author of the derivative work failed to meet
his/her duty to disclose the source code, more likely, the author of the
derivative work will not have to disclose the source code since it i) is
not known publicly, and ii) is the subject of considerable effort to
maintain its secrecy, and iii) has independent economic value, and
therefore is qualified as a trade secret.[^korea_85] This holding is to be
criticized as described in the section entitled “FOSS Cases in Korea.”

## Remedies for Infringement

### Under the Copyright Act

The principles that apply to other copyrightable works apply to FOSS
when authors claim remedies and criminal sanctions under the Act.
Standing to sue differs depending on whether the work is a joint work, a
collective work, or a derivative work as described in the section
entitled “Analysis of FOSS under Korean Law.”[^korea_86]

### Breach of License Agreement or Copyright Infringement, Compensation for Damages

When there is a breach of a FOSS agreement, a determination must be made
of if the breach constitutes a breach of contract and further a
copyright infringement. If the breach corresponds to exclusive rights,
which are guaranteed under the Act, the breach may be treated as a
copyright infringement. Because there are no court precedents that deal
with this issue head-on, the herculean task of making such
determinations is set before the Korean judiciary. While it is by no
means a complete guide to the subject, there is a case that may shed
some light on this particular issue. In the case where an author of a
derivative work based on GPL’d FOSS failed his duty to disclose its
source code, the Supreme Court did not clarify whether such was a breach
of a contract or constituted an infringement of copyrights. The lack of
clarity came from the Supreme Court’s usage of the phrases “violation of
the GPL agreement” and “the copyright holder” in its decision. The Court
pointed out that such decisions are held separately from the issue of
whether the author of derivative work who violates the GPL agreement may
be liable for damages to the copyright holder of the original work.
However, the lower court made it clear that the author of a derivative
work who used a GPL’d FOSS, without disclosing the source code, is in
violation of the GPL and is liable for damages to the copyright holder
of the original work for copyright infringement.[^korea_87] The details of the
case are to be discussed in the following section. To determine the
proper cause of action under which compensation for breach of a license
agreement is sought, the form of the infringement and the nature of the
infringed rights should be analyzed. If the object of the infringement
is a component of the copyrights as defined under the Act, the Act is
applicable and the special measures as stated in Part I will apply. On
the other hand, when the object of infringement is a contractual license
obligation, which is not fulfilled, contract law under the Korean Civil
Act would apply. If a licensee breaches a FOSS license agreement, the
licensor may apply for specific performance[^korea_88] or terminate the
license agreement[^korea_89] upon occurrence of a termination event or upon
expiry of period of notification for performance as provided under FOSS
license[^korea_90] or claim damages.[^korea_91] The licensor may file under the
Civil Execution Act, with a provisional disposition to keep the licensee
from using the FOSS program or to disclose its source code until the
relevant judgment is held.

## FOSS Cases in Korea

### Elimnet v. Haionnet

An employee of Elimnet (the Developer) created a derivative work using
GPL’d FOSS during his employment and assigned the copyright to the
company. Elimnet used the derivative work for its business. After a
while, the Developer resigned from Elimnet without disclosing the source
code of the derivative work to company. He later founded Haionnet and
used the modified version of the derivative work for its Haionnet’s
business. Elimnet filed a complaint arguing that the Developer used
Elimnet’s trade secrets without permission. The Developer was charged
with the violation of the Trade Secret Protection Act. The Supreme Court
held that in view of the assignment contract of the copyright between
Elimnet and the Developer, Elimnet was the copyright holder of the
derivative work based on the GPL’d software; the same court did not
address whether Elimnet should be liable for damages to the copyright
holder of the original GPL’d software. The court further held that the
source code of the derivative work was Elimnet’s trade secret since the
source code of the derivative work i) was not known publicly, ii) had
independent economic value and iii) was maintained as a secret through
considerable effort. However, a strict application of the court’s
decision in this case can be criticized as below. The purpose of
protecting trade secret is to prevent infringers from gaining unjust
profit through unfair competition, rather than to protect trade secret
itself.[^korea_92] The copyright holder of the original work allowed users to
modify the work under the condition that users disclose the source code
of the modified program to the public, along wide public access to the
modified program. A refusal by either a user or developer to fulfill
his/her obligations would lead to the automatic termination of the
license. The lower court held that refusing to disclose the source code
of the modified program would be an infringement of the original
copyright holder’s right of modification: the act of using the modified
program without disclosing its source code would be an infringement of
the copyrights of the original author because it exploited the
creativity of the original author without his/her permission.[^korea_93] It is
in doubt whether the derivative author of a GPL’d software who has
violated the terms of the license agreement can be regarded as a fair
competitor who should be protected under the Trade Secret Protection
Act. Moreover, the information must be maintained in confidence to be
recognized as a trade secret. Secrecy is maintained only when it is kept
in confidence by the legitimate holder, who holds the lawful right to
use the trade secret.[^korea_94] The modifier holds the copyright of the
derivative work, but does not hold the copyright for the original work.
Because the derivative work is in generally inseparable from the
original software, the modifier inevitably infringes the copyright of
the original program whenever he/she uses the derivative work without
permission of the original author. Therefore, in such circumstances, the
derivative author may not necessarily be regarded as a holder of a
lawful right to use the derivative work or a derivative author who
should be protected under the Criminal Act. Protecting a company’s
derivative work as a trade secret when it was created by infringing the
copyright holder‘s original work does not conform to the purpose of the
Trade Secret Act. Moreover, as previously discussed, since the source
code of the derivative work may not satisfy the conditions of a trade
secret, the court’s holding that acknowledged the derivative work, an
undisclosed source code of FOSS, as a trade secret may be criticized.
Such a court holding does not conform to the original copyright holder’s
intent to make the software as free and open as possible, which might
hinder the active use and development of FOSS in Korea.
