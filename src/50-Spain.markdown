## Introduction to software protection under Spanish law

### Body of law

Copyright protection of software is regulated in Spain under Royal
Legislative Decree 1/1996 of 12 April, approving the consolidated text
of the Copyright Act (hereinafter, the “Copyright Act”)[^spain_1]. This law
transposes the EU Copyright Directives (Directive 2001/29/EC on the
harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the
information society, Directive 2004/48/EC on the enforcement of
intellectual property rights; Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection
of databases; and, in particular, Council Directive 91/250/EEC of 14 May
1991 on the Legal Protection of Computer Programs — hereinafter referred
to as the “Software Directive”).

Title VII of Book I of the Copyright Act (Articles 95-104) specifically
regulates copyright in computer programs. These provisions are
considered *lex specialis* with respect to the general provisions of
Copyright Act, as *lex generalis*.[^spain_2] This means that the general
provisons of the Copyright Act will apply to computer programs to the
extent that Book I, Title VII does not contain any specific provisions.

### Object of protection

Computer programs are specifically included in the non-exhaustive list
of literary, artistic and scientific works protected by copyright, in
Article 10.1(i). Computer programs are defined in Article 96 as “any
sequence of instructions or indications destined to be used directly or
indirectly in a computer system to performe a function or task or obtain
a determined result, whatsoever its form of expression or fixation”, and
include their preparatory material. Computer Program copyright
protection is also extended to technical documentation and user manuals.
Only original computer programs benefit copyright protection[^spain_3].
According to Article 96.2 of the Copyright Act, the computer program
needs to be the own intellectual creation of the author, which has led
authors and judges to hold that the work must be new and bear, in some
manner, the print of the author’s persona (which, in computer
programming, does not have to be a high level at all)[^spain_4]. The ideas and
principles behind computer programs including those which serve as the
basis for its interfaces are explicitly denied copyright protection[^spain_5].
Malware such as computer viruses, is also excluded from protection.

### Authors/Beneficiaries

The Copyright Act generally provides that copyrights in a work belong to
the author, who is the person or group of persons who creates the
work[^spain_6]. In respect of computer programs, Article 97.4 adds, however,
that where computer programs are created by one or more employees in the
execution of their duties or following the instructions given by their
employer, the employer will be deemed to be the exclusive rightsholder
of the economic rights in the computer programs so created, unless
expressly provided otherwise[^spain_7]. In these circumstances, employee
authors will maintain their moral rights over the work (see below),
while the economic rights belong — by legislated automatic transmission
of rights — to the employer[^spain_8].

The law also provides for works with multiple authors. Joint works
(works that are the unique result of the collaborative efforts of a
variety of persons) are the property of all the authors and the rights
correspond to them as they may agree. In default, the rights are held
equally. Each author may exploit his/her contribution to the work,
provided this exploitation does not prejudice exploitation of the work
as a whole[^spain_9].

The rights over a “collective work” — a program created by initiative
and under the coordination of a person that edits and disseminates it
(an “editor”, basically), and consisting in the composition of several
contributions (made for this purpose by different authors) which merge
into a single and unique work --- without being able to attribute
ownership rights to one author in particular — belong to the editor,
unless contractually provided otherwise[^spain_10].

Finally, the Copyright Act also establises the concept of a “composed”
or “composite” work, being a work which incorporates one or more
previously existing works without the colaboration of the prior author.
Rights in the composed work belong to the person who performs such
composition, without prejudice to the rights of (and the need for
authorisation from) the prior author[^spain_11].

### Economic rights

According to Article 99 of the Copyright Act, the economic rights in
computer programs comprise the exclusive rights to perform or authorise
the performance of :

(a) permanent or temporary reproduction of a computer program by any
means and in any form, in part or in whole (including when the acts of
loading, executing, displaying, transmission and storage of the program
require a reproduction);

(b) translation, adaptation, arrangement or alteration of a computer
program, and the reproduction of any such transformed work; and

(c) any form of distribution to the public, including the rental, of the
original computer program or copies thereof.

Article 99 does not mention the right of public communication (e.g.
transmission of a program in intangible form via Internet), however as
the other provisions of the Copyright Act apply in the absence of
specific provision, it is understood that Article 20 of the Copyright
Act grants the rightsholders the exclusive right to publicly communicate
the computer program.

### Exceptions to exclusive rights

Article 99, last paragraph, expressly provides that the first sale in
the European Union of a copy of a program by the rightholder or with his
consent shall exhaust the distribution right of that copy within the
Community, with the exception of the right to control further rental of
the program or a copy thereof. This is understood to apply only to
tangible copies (i.e. programs on a CD or DVD, flashcard, etc.), as the
distribution right is limited to the computer programs in tangible
media.[^spain_12] And it does not exhaust the reprodution and transformation
rights.

The other exceptions are set out in Article 100 of the Copyright Act:

(1) In the absence of specific contractual provisions, no authorisation
by the rightholder is required for reproduction or transformation of a
computer program that are necessary for its use by the lawful user in
accordance with its intended purpose, including error correction.

(2) Reproduction by way of a back-up copy of a computer program by a
person having a right to use it may not be prevented, insofar as that
copy is necessary to use the program.

(3) A person having a right to use a copy of a computer program is
entitled, without the authorisation of the rightholder, to observe,
study or test the functioning of the program in order to determine the
ideas and principles which underlie any element of the program, provided
he/she does so while lawfully performing any of the acts of loading,
displaying, running, transmitting or storing the program.

This article basically restates the three exceptions of Article 5 of the
Software Directive.

Articles 100.5-100.7 of the Copyright Act explain in detail the
circumstances in which a legitimate user of a computer program may
reproduce and/or translate a computer program without the prior
authorisation of the rightsholder, in order to obtain the information
necessary to achieve the interoperability of an independently created
computer program with other programs[^spain_13].

The Act expressly provides that these exceptions, except that set out in
Article 100.1 (reproduction and transformation necessary for use) are
compulsory law. Hence, contractual provisions to the contrary are deemed
not to be valid. However, the exercise of these statutory rights is
often difficult in practice because the licensee generally has no access
to the source code of the application and it is not obvious to enforce
this access legally.

### Moral rights

The Copyright Act makes no mention of moral rights in relation to
computer programs. These are regulated by Article 14 of the Act, which
is understood to apply to computer programs like any other protected
work[^spain_14]. These rights include the paternity right and the right to
oppose modifications and applications which might affect the honor or
reputation of the author[^spain_15]. These rights are inaliable and
unwaivable[^spain_16], and remain in force following the death of the author.

### Term of protection

Article 98 of the Copyright Act provides that the same term of copyright
applies to computer programs as for general protected works: 70 years
following the 1st January after the death of the author. For juridical
persons holding rights (employers or rightsholder in a collective work),
the term is 70 years from the 1st January of the year after first
legitimate public dissemination of the program (or its creation, if it
is not published)[^spain_17].

Rights in a co-authored (joint) work last until 70 years after the death
of the last co-author. As regards collective works, having a unique
rightsholder (the editor), the copyrights last for 70 years after first
legal publication of the work. However, if the natural authors are
mentioned in the published versions, rights in the work have the same
general term: life (or dissemination) plus 70 years.

### Copyright assignment

Economic rights in computer programs may be transferred to third
parties, *mortis causa* or *inter vivos*[^spain_18]. This is done by operation
of law in the case of employee created works, as we have seen above.
Otherwise, all *inter vivos* transfers must be formalised in writing
(paper or electronic)[^spain_19]. The transfer of rights is limited to the
specific rights, use, term and geographic scope stated in the
contract/license. If the contract does not state these terms, transfers
are deemed non-exclusive, for 5 years, for the country where the
transfer is made, and only for the purposes that are necessarily deduced
from the contract and necessary for fulfilling its purpose.

If there is no contract for the transfer of rights, no rights are
transfered.[^spain_20] However, in the case of commissioned works (e.g. from
consultant programmers), the commissioner will have a limited use right,
limited in the same manner as above: having only such rights as are
necessarily deduced from the circumstances of the engagement, and
necessary for fulfilling its purpose[^spain_21]. In addition, depending on the
degree of participation of the commissioning party (client) (e.g.
providing the program design and detailed specifications), one could
consider the resulting work to be either a collective work, for which
the client is rights holder *ab initio* as editor of the work, or even a
collaborative work in which the client is co-author.

Transfers of rights can be exclusive or non-exclusive. There is no such
concept as “assignment” or “sale” of all the rights or copyright
property to a third party (this is contradictory to the concept of moral
rights)[^spain_22]. The closest transfer to an “assignment” is an irrevocable,
exclusive transfer or license of all the rights, for all purposes, for
all the duration of the rights and all the countries of the world.

Exclusive transfers must be expressly stated as such, and may be for
one, several or all the copyright rights. The exclusive licensee may
grant non-exclusive licences to third parties, and also has legal
standing to defend the rights in court, independently from the original
rightsholder. The exclusive licensee must also exploit the work, or lose
its license.

The Copyright Act establishes specifically that, unless proof is
provided to the contrary, the granting of any use license will be
considered non-exclusive and non-transferable, only for the purpose of
satisfying the needs of the user[^spain_23]. Non-exclusive rights may not be
onwards-transfered, nor sub-licensed.

Copyright transfers may be royalty bearing or for free. This issue is
independent of the rights that are granted. Payments may be one-off, or
a proportional participation in the profits of exploitation of the work
(royalties)[^spain_24].

### Copyright enforcement

Article 102 of the Copyright Act establishes the terms of breach of
copyright: the unauthorised performance of any exclusive rights
(reproduction, transformation, distribution, public communication), and
in particular:

(a) the commercialisation (putting into circulation) of any copies of a
program which the marketer knows or could be deemed to know are illegal

(b) the possession for commercial purposes of any such copies

(c) the commercialisation or possession for commercial purposes of tools
which are exclusively aimed at facilitating the unlawful removal or
avoidance of technical means which protect the computer program
(TPMs)[^spain_25].

This latter provision (Article 102(c)) is specifically aimed at
protecting DRM and technical protection measures, and it was not
considered necessary to change these provision in 2004 or 2006 to
implement the EU Copyright Directives. Criminal law also penalises any
copyright infringement for commercial purposes (“for profit” motive),
with specific emphasis on removing TPMs[^spain_26].

## Unprotected software and public domain software

As set forth above, only software that is original in the sense that it
is an intellectual creation of the author benefits copyright protection.
Non-original software does not come into consideration for copyright
protection and can, in principle, be used freely. Due to the functional
nature of many programs, the degree of originality for software is not
considered to have to be particularly high, and basically a subjective
criteria: of being the result of personal effort that is not copied from
another work, is sufficient[^spain_27].

Under Spanish law, public domain is limited to works for which the
copyrights have expired[^spain_28]. This software — if there is any
today! — can be used, reproduced or executed freely, without permission
or the payment of a fee. It can in certain cases even be presented by
third parties as their own work, and by modifying the original work,
third parties can take certain versions of the public domain software
out of the public domain again.

## FOSS under Spanish law

From a conceptual and legal point of view, FOSS is like any other
computer program, and benefits from the protection granted by copyright
law. Spanish copyright law fully supports the rights of the copyright
holder (usually the author) to establish determined conditions in the
software license, having the exclusive right to exercise or authorise
the exercise of the rights of reproduction, transformation and
distribution (and public communication). So, save for public policy
prohibitions, a rightsholder is free to choose the conditions under
which he or she licenses a computer program to third parties.

Under Spanish law, FOSS would be considered as software to which users
generally have more rights, via the FOSS license agreement, than they
would have with a proprietary or “non-free” software license[^spain_29]. And,
like any other software license, the FOSS license conditions must be
respected by the licensee (user), or the license permissions may be
revoked.

### Copyright issues

#### Multiple authorship

Although FOSS can be written by one person or be owned by one legal
entity[^spain_30], generally speaking, after some time it is extended,
improved, corrected and generally transformed, becoming the result of
the work of several authors who can make claims to it. The question is
whether later additions create a collaborative work (a work created by
collaborating authors), or whether the original software is the work and
every contribution created during the further development of the
software, a derivative or composed work. The legal consequences are
different.

#### Qualification of FOSS

For FOSS to be a work created by means of a collaborative process, i.e.
to be considered a “collaborative work” of co-authors, it is not
necessary for every co-author to have contributed equally[^spain_31] (rarely
the case), nor are co-authors required to work on it at the same time
(in most cases, not the case) although to be considered an author the
contributor must intervene during the creative process (i.e not a tester
or non-substantial bug-fixer). However, to be a co-author, the
contribution needs to be worthy of protection by copyright. The provider
of an idea is not a co-author, nor is the person who corrects a
technical error or merely follows instructions[^spain_32].

Whereas the first version of a software program, if written by several
people, can in many cases be qualified as a collaborative work
(co-authorship), this seems much less the case for the later versions,
which are based on the original work without, however, there being any
“consultation” or direct collaboration between the authors. These later
versions would be qualified as “derivative works”, or possibly
collective works (if the author/editor of the new version collated a
series of different programs to form a distinct new software based on
the original). Therefore, in terms of the legal consequences, a
distinction needs to be made between the rights of the original
co-authors and the rights of subsequent authors who carry out work based
on the original.

#### Rights of the original co-authors

Co-authorship usually concerns the creation of a single “unique” work
that is more than the collection of its component parts[^spain_33]. The
contributions may be indivisible, i.e. each individual contribution is
not clearly identifiable, e.g. when two authors write a text together.
But it is not necessarily the case: under Spanish law there may be
co-authorship even when the several components are distinguishable, but
## brought together in a single work in which all the authors are involved

As we have seen above, in the case of collaborative works, the authors
are free to regulate the exercise of the copyrights by agreement.
Co-authors can agree how the program is made public (e.g. under a FOSS
license) and how decisions regarding the copyrights are made, e.g. by
normal or special majorities, or give one of them the right to make all
decisions regarding this work. They can also reach an agreement as to
the economic rights, such as royalty payments, and moral rights e.g.
under whose name the work will be published[^spain_35].

If the co-authors have not reached an agreement, neither of the authors
is allowed to exercise the copyright separately, however each may
exploit his/her own contribution separately if this exploitation does
not prejudice exploitation of the work as a whole. So if a programmer
wishes to use his or her contribution in another manner, this will be
possible, provided this does not create, for example, a competing
product. In the absence of agreement, unanimity is required for
decisions, and in the absence of unanimity the court decides, and the
court will decide according to the provisions of the Civil Code in
relation joint properties[^spain_36] (which usually means a majority rule, and
by default contributions are deemed equal unless proof to the contrary
is provided). The court will also weigh different factors to be taken
into account, including good faith, the degree of collaboration, the
degree of substitution of the different contributions, etc.[^spain_37]

As each author has the right to exploit his/her contribution, it is
clear that he/she may, in his/her name and without intervention of the
other authors, institute legal proceedings for an infringement of
copyright in the work, and in her contribution. This is clear in so far
as such proceedings are for an injunction to end the infringement[^spain_38].
What is not so clear is the right to individual compensation and it is
thought that for these cases, the consent of the co-authors is required
(see above). However, in some cases the lack of unanimity may result in
the inadmissibility of this claim, e.g. if heirs of a programmer are
unable to agree as to whether to institute a claim[^spain_39].

#### Authors of derivative / composed FOSS works

After some time FOSS will, in most cases, be a derivative work of the
original or a composed work which includes it. Derivative works and
composed works are works which reproduce parts or characteristics of the
original work, and in which the new authors bring an original
contribution (thus creating a new work) by way of transformation or
composition of the orignal. The author(s) of the derivative or composed
work hold independent and full copyright rights in the new work. They
are, however, restricted because the derivative or composed work cannot
be exploited without the consent of the holder of the copyright on the
original work. Under FOSS licenses this consent is not a problem,
subject to respecting the terms and conditions (e.g. regarding further
distribution of the derivative work)[^spain_40]. This issue gives rise to
certain difficulties as it is not always clear if the use of the
previous work is by way of mere reproduction (or compilation into a new
work), or by transformation of the previous work — depending on the FOSS
licenses, different conditions may apply. This may be key to
understanding the impact of copyleft obligations in the GPL (v2 or v3).

#### The management of copyrights in FOSS — transfers?

In order to manage copyrights in FOSS better, it may be useful to
collect all copyrights concerning a FOSS project within one person or
organisation. The existence of this organisation will simplify the
management and enforcement of the (eventually joint) copyrights[^spain_41].
The collective management of copyrights is perfectly possible under
Spanish law, and is usually, but not necessarily, regulated by an
exclusive license or transfer of copyrights to the person or
organisation in question. As an alternative, the rightsholders may
authorise an organisation to take legal action in respect of their
work — as a fiduciary, the party to whom the legitimation is granted
shall not act for himself but on account of others who have so
authorised him/her (being the current rightsholders)[^spain_42].

### Moral copyrights

Generally speaking, FOSS originated in the United States, and FOSS
licensing tends to attach less importance to the question of moral
rights of the author[^spain_43], however it must be noted that one common
factor among all FOSS licenses is the obligation to maintain attribution
to the original authors, and indicate any modifications — a contractual
form of guaranteeing certain moral rights (paternity and integrity).

The Open Source Definition specifies that the author of software
distributed under a FOSS license cannot oppose the use of the software
by certain people and groups[^spain_44] or for certain areas of
application[^spain_45]. This runs contrary to the moral rights of an author
with respect to the uses to be made of his/her work. It is clear under
Spanish law that an author is not able to give up his/her moral rights
in his/her work[^spain_46]: any waiver to exercise in the future one’s moral
rights is void, including moral rights on software[^spain_47]. The author of a
work distributed under the FOSS license should theoretically therefore
be able to oppose any use of his/her work by people or groups or for
certain purposes which affect his honour or reputation, based on his/her
moral rights.

Moral rights are also carried through to derivative works: the author of
the original work will therefore, based on his/her moral rights, not
only be able to oppose the use by third parties of his work, but also
the use of derivative works which affect his/her honour or reputation.

### Enforcing FOSS licenses

The question whether a FOSS license can be enforced under the Spanish
legal system depends on whether a valid license has been granted. The
essential questions are: (i) between whom is a license reached, (ii) has
the license been validly reached and (iii) what are its terms?

Another dimension to this debate is whether a FOSS license can only be
considered a contract (requiring formalisation as such: an offer and its
acceptance, being a manifestation of consent to be bound by the terms,
often absent in FOSS practice), or seen as merely conditions to an
authorisation or form of donation (donation not of the software, but of
the non-exclusive rights to use them). Doctrine in Spain generally holds
that copyright licenses are contracts[^spain_48], although there may be scope
in Spanish law for arguing against the need to prove the requisites of a
contract, and merely defend the instrument as establishing the
conditions to be applied to the authorisation to use the software
(breach of which gives rise to a mere breach of copyrights).

Note however that it will not be in the interest of the licensee to
prove that a license has not been granted (whether by contract or
otherwise), as by default the law provides that third parties may not
exercise any exploitation rights without due authorisation (or
eventually, if a license can be deemed, the licensee’s use rights are de
minimis use rights provided by law: those necessary for fulfilling the
purpose of a contract). So from a licensee’s point of view, there is no
point in attacking the existence of the license, but, should there be
any conflict, rather the validity and scope/interpretation of the terms.

#### License parties

If a rightsholder makes his/her work available under a FOSS license, the
answer as to parties is usually clear: the license is reached between
the rightsholder and the licensee. In case of several co-authors, the
situation may be more complicated, and the question as to with whom the
licensee reaches a contract depends on the mutual agreement between the
co-authors[^spain_49].

Often, a FOSS program will be the work of several authors who did not
work in joint collaboration. After all, FOSS is usually created via a
chain of authors who all contribute to the creation of the program that
is, in the end, licensed to the user/licensee. In so far as each new
author makes an original contribution to the work, a derivative work is
produced[^spain_50]. The licensee of the eventual work will need to have the
consent of every author in the chain who made an original contribution
to the final work, starting with the author of the first work or
version. This consent can be direct, or indirect by giving consent in
the FOSS license to the next author to modify and distribute the work
(verbatim or as modified).

Insofar as an “editor” (such as Red Hat or Novell) collates different
FOSS works into a new package, a collective work may be created, and the
licensee will have a license from, and need the consent of, the
editor — who in turn will have to manage the upstream licenses.

Most FOSS licenses solve this by creating binding conditions between the
licensee and all authors in the chain. GPL version 3, for instance,
contains the following clause: “Each time you convey a covered work, the
recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors,
to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License”[^spain_51]
and GPL version 2: “each time you redistribute the Program (or any work
based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license
from the original licensor”[^spain_52].

In this way the user of the software obtains a license of all authors in
the chain. This chain of licenses is valid under Spanish law, and it is
argued that it must be this way, as non-exclusive licensees (the
intermediate creators, in the chain) are not entitled to relicense or
sublicense the original work.

#### Validity of the license — as a contract or otherwise

Contracts in Spanish law require an offer and acceptance of the offer by
way of a manifestation of a consent to be bound by the terms of the
offer[^spain_53]. Conventional IT agreements are reached by the explicit
acceptance of the terms and conditions by the licensee through signing
the terms and conditions, by opening the packaging, by clicking or
selecting an “I agree” button, or indeed by any other action from which
acceptance can be deduced. These methods to reach a licensing agreement
have been sufficiently tried and tested and, at least between commercial
parties, are generally considered to be valid[^spain_54].

Typically, in a FOSS environment, however, software is made available
with the simple specification on a website (“licensed under the GPLv2
license”) or in the source code of the software itself (in the code file
header and with luck, in a “COPYING.txt” file or a `/legal/` folder).
The license is not usually required to be explicitly accepted, nor are
the terms presented to the licensee/user. Having to click and confirm
every time could in some cases interfere with the use of the
software[^spain_55]. In addition, the Open Source Definition opposes demanding
explicit agreement to the license conditions with the aim of confirming
the agreement between licensor and licensee[^spain_56].

The question is double: whether in these cases a valid license has been
entered into, and what are the applicable terms. The answer to the first
question must be affirmative. The reason is that the user of a copyright
protected work needs to be able to indicate the grounds on which he/she
is authorised to use the work. As we have seen, using software without
the rightsholder’s consent implies a copyright infringement. This
implies that everyone who wants to use software which they find via the
internet, needs to actively look for a license. If the user cannot prove
he/she has a license[^spain_57], he/she must refrain from using it.

The trouble is that, without having had an opportunity to review the
terms and thus consent to them (and, sometimes in the case of FOSS, the
rightsholder not properly indicating the applicable terms, if any, other
than stating that the software is “free software”), the licensee may be
in a position to argue that certain terms are not applicable or part of
the agreement. Against this, the licensor would generally argue that, in
the absence of proof to the contrary, the FOSS license conditions are
the only terms under which he or she licenses the FOSS, and thus if the
user now disagrees to any of the terms, then the licensor has granted no
license to the licensee and any use of the software is thus a breach of
copyright. Furthermore, Spanish courts would look, in the professional
sector, at the uses and customs in the sector, to determine if
sufficient opportunity was granted to read and accept the terms, and it
is now fairly well established that free software licensing terms are
available to be read in the source code or on the project website, and
most software developers know and apply this custom. Accordingly, as
regards professional developers who are FOSS licensees, it would be very
difficult to argue that there was no binding license between the
parties, or that the terms are unknown[^spain_58].

As we have noted above, it is doubtful whether any user would benefit
from disputing the existence of a FOSS license (except with regard to
disclaimers, for which see below). If the user disputes the conclusion
or validity of the FOSS license, this implies that no legally valid
copyright license was granted and the user therefore is not allowed to
use the software at all.

#### Violation of license conditions

Breach of a FOSS license by a user/licensee could constitute a double
infringement in Spain: contractual breach of binding license
obligations, and breach of copyrights of the rightsholder. The
rightsholder may take action in civil courts under both claims (and due
to the possibility of arguing against the existence or need for a
contract, it would be recommended to sue on both grounds). In addition,
breach of copyright provides several interesting remedies[^spain_59].

### Disclaimers and liability

Typically, FOSS licenses contain very strong disclaimer clauses, which
attempt to discharge the author from all liability[^spain_60]. The argument
given for this is that FOSS is often made available without a fee, as a
result of which the author/rightsholder generates insufficient income to
pay for liability insurance and legal costs[^spain_61].

Although this reasoning is certainly valid for the amateur programmer,
it applies much less for professional programmers who build their
business model around FOSS[^spain_62]. To cover the eventuality of being held
liable for a warranty of title or quality, professional suppliers of
FOSS or related services often provide guarantees and technical
support[^spain_63].

Article 1902 of the Spanish Civil Code provides for strict liability and
indemnities for wilful misconduct (“culpa”) or negligence
(“negligencia”) in an extra-contractaul context (i.e. tort, including
breach of copyrights), as does Article 1101 for contractual liability.
Damages for wilful misconduct may not be excluded at all, and those
caused by negligence are subject to review by the courts. Liability
under these provisions would apply both in the context of any problem
with relation to title (copyright in the code) or quality of the
software. In addition, with respect to quality, suppliers in a
commercial relationship are liable to repair damages caused by hidden
defects (Articles 1461 and 1484 Civil Code).

More specifically as regards title, although in Spanish law there is no
such concept as a “warranty of title”, it is implicit that a licensor
must have sufficient rights to be able to grant a FOSS license — in
absence of which, the supplier will not only be in breach of the third
party’s copyright (and thus, in breach of the obligation to ensure the
licensee’s right of quite enjoyment[^spain_64]) but also liable under the
aforementioned provisions relating to fraud or negligence.

However, between professionals, the law allows parties to regulate
liability (except for fraud, and even negligence may not be wholely
excluded), for example limiting damages to the price paid for software
or establishing a process for maintenance and bug correction. In all
circumstances, the courts will look at the balance of rights and
obligations between the parties, in which case for FOSS significant
weight may be given to the free (gratis) nature of FOSS, as well as the
wide scope of rights granted to the licensee, as a balance against the
wide disclaimers.

It is doubtful whether the exoneration clauses or disclaimers contained
in FOSS licenses comply in full with the general validity requirements
under Spanish law, especially in relation to a consumer licensee. These
requirements include that the clauses are not against the principle of
good faith, do not upset the balance of obligations and rights between
the parties, and are not subject to the unilateral discretion of one
party (the licensor). Thus it will depend on each circumstance whether
the disclaimer clauses will be seen as valid or not: the drafting of the
clause, the balance of the parties, the knowledge and experience of the
licensee, etc. When the disclaimer does not include the now-standard
expression “to the extent permitted by mandatory applicable law” (as in
the BSD or MIT License), the clause may be struck out as invalid, in
part or in whole, as contradictory to the aforementioned provisions of
the Civil Code (if not also consumer protection laws, see below). It is
also important to look at how the licensor presents the product
(differentiating, for example, system libraries or components, such as
MySQL, and end-user products such as Firefox or the GIMP). For a product
that is presented as finished and ready for use, the exoneration clause
will be considered invalid much more easily, than for a product for
which the licensor clearly formulated a reservation[^spain_65].

In so far as the aforementioned conditions have been complied with,
exoneration provisions will be enforceable in principle, unless the
stipulating party could be considered as a professional seller in a
relationship with a consumer purchaser[^spain_66]. As mentioned above,
professional sellers are required to repair hidden defects in the
products they sell, except if the purchaser is a specialist in the
sector, under Article 1484 of the Spanish Civil Code. Contractual
provisions may modify this, if they are validly incorporated in the
contract and not invalidated for other reasons (see above, and in
particular by consumer protection laws). If the hidden defects are
known, and this state is not declared to the purchaser, then the
supplier will be liable not only to repair the defect but also for
damages and interest[^spain_67]. The professional seller of FOSS may therefore
be liable in principle, unless he can provide proof of his ignorance of
the bugs/mistakes. In practice while this proof will be hard to provide
(through due diligence in testing, programming process and methodology,
etc), take into account that it is generally accepted that software is
buggy and virtually impossible to make perfectly.

Finally, these disclaimers will usually be held invalid with respect to
consumer users, both due to the scope of the disclaimers (being deemed
abusive[^spain_68]) and due to the fact that a consumer in Spain would not be
expected to be able to understand a disclaimer in English (the language
of most FOSS licenses) and thus held not to be incorporated in the
consumer contract. On the other hand, it could be argued that as there
is no commercial relationship between the parties (and thus, the
licensor is not a “seller” of a product), then consumer protection law
may not apply to the full extent[^spain_69]. This argument is reinforced by
the free (gratis) nature of most FOSS.

### The copyleft principle

#### Principle

A characteristic found in several (but not all[^spain_70]) FOSS licenses is
the so-called “copyleft” principle. Copyleft FOSS licenses, in return
for the use rights that are granted, require anyone who redistributes
the copylefted software or any derivative works of it to third parties,
to do so under the same license conditions[^spain_71]. Thus, usually it would
not be legally possible to incorporate and redistribute copyright
protected parts of copylefted software in a proprietary licensed work.

It has been argued that this copyleft principle can restrict the
commercial use possibilities of the software[^spain_72]. Warnings have also
been issued regarding the dangers that companies may run if a negligent
or vindictive employee were to incorporate a piece of copyleft code in a
proprietary software program. In theory this could mean that the company
would be obliged to make its proprietary software available under a
copyleft FOSS license or remove it from the market. Although caution is
necessary, one can ask whether these “worst-case scenarios” are
realistic under Spanish law. The sanction for incorporating copyleft
code in proprietary software and distributing this under a closed or
proprietary license will usually be restricted to (a) a prohibition to
distribute the software whose license has been breached or (b) the
obligation to remove this piece of code from the program. In addition,
if the unlawful use has caused damage to the author, this damage will
need to be reimbursed, but not more than the damage actually suffered
(e.g. indemnities to the original copyright holder)[^spain_73]. But in all
events it is unlikely the owner of the proprietary software would be
obliged to release all its code under the copyleft FOSS license.

#### Validity of copyleft obligations

The question relating to the validity of the copyleft clause coincides
with the question whether a rightsholder is able to validly establish
the conditions under which derivative or composite works must be
distributed. The answer to this question is affirmative: while the
righsholder of the original work does not hold any copyright in the
derivative work, he or she is entitled to determine the conditions for
the creation and redistribution of a derivative work of his/her original
work[^spain_74]. A derivative work can therefore only be exploited subject to
the consent of the copyright owner of the original work[^spain_75].

As copyright holder, an author is thus able to authorise the use of
his/her work for a particular use, and link certain conditions to this.
This right to determine the destined use or conditions of use of a work
is clearly stated in the Copyright Act, in Article 43[^spain_76]. The
rightsholder can therefore impose the copyleft condition based on these
rights.

All rights are subject to control against abuse, including copyright:
contractual conditions must comply with mandatorily applicable laws
(such as consumer protection, data privacy, etc.) morality and public
order. An author cannot therefore randomly exercise his/her economic and
moral rights. However, exercising his/her copyrights (by determining the
conditions of exploitation) cannot be considered as an abuse of rights
“as such”: only in exceptional cases will an author who invokes his/her
copyrights be guilty of an abuse of rights[^spain_77]. We consider that
licensing a work under a copyleft restriction will in principle not
constitute an abuse of right, because the author, in general, will be
able to prove a legitimate moral or tangible interest (and indeed a
public interest to maintain the code in the “commons”). A legitimate
moral interest could be that of wanting to keep the work within the FOSS
community, including in modified form.

It is argued that the copyleft provisions may only affect works to which
the rightsholder is granted rights to control: the original work,
derivative works, and composite works incorporating the original work.
Copyright rights are not granted with respect of independent works not
included in this list, and it may be considered an abuse of (copyright)
rights trying to extend those conditions or provisions beyond that which
the Copyright Law has permitted the author to control. Including for
example, works in the public domain, works not protected by copyright,
and independent works e.g. stored on the same carrier as the licensed
work[^spain_78].

However there is also an argument that, the license being considered a
contract, the licensee may be bound by whatever (legally valid)
conditions are imposed in the license, even outside the scope of
copyright law and including as to “non-derivative/composite/collective”
works. This is subject to limitations, of course. Competition law, for
example, would prohibit certain forms of product bundling or
restrictions on legitimate uses[^spain_79], and consumer protection law would
prohibit restrictions imposing conditions on certain forms of claims for
redress or indemnities.

In addition, it has been argued that copyleft restrictions may run
contrary to the exhaustion principle (with regard to the distribution
right). However, the Copyright Act specifies: “The first sale in the
European Union of a copy of a program by the copyright owner or with his
consent results in the exhaustion of the right to control the
distribution of that copy in the European Union, with the exception of
the right to control the further leasing and lending out of the program
or a copy thereof.”[^spain_80] Note that his “exhaustion” only applies to
controlling the tangible copy which has been lawfully released in the
European market. This does not affect the right of the author to lay
down certain conditions regarding the use of the (intangible) work on
that copy. The conditions of use established in the license on this work
“run” with the tangible copy, as the sole authorisation to exploit the
intangible work on that copy.

## FOSS cases in Spain

While there have been several cases regarding the use of free content
(specifically within the context of paying collecting societies' levies,
or not, and the burden of proof[^spain_81]), there have been no cases
regarding free and/or open source software. The judicial consideration
of “copyleft” as a concept within the aforementioned free content cases
is interesting, showing an increasing awareness of judges with respect
to FOSS licensing models.

## Legal procedures

### Legal action

With regard to the enforcement of copyrights in Spain, Articles 138-140
of the Copyright Act provide for a broad range of actions, in line with
the EC IPR Enforement Directive 2004/48/EC. These actions include:

a) Preliminary measures including (i) seizure of both infringing
software/goods and devices, (ii) embargo of bank accounts where profits
may have been deposited, and (iii) suspension of non-authorised
activities

b) Injunctions to (i) cease and desist from the illicit activity, (ii)
remove from the market any infringing articles, (iii) destroy any illict
software and devices, and (iv) suspend ISP services used infringing IPR
rights.

c) Damages and interest (see below)

Legitimation for taking action is vested in the copyright holder or an
exclusive licensee of the infringed copyright (i.e. either or both may
take action). Non-exclusive licensees may not, however a third party
(e.g. a fiduciary) may be authorised by a copyright holder to take
action on his/her behalf. Only authors may claim for breach of moral
rights.

Proceedings are taken before the Civil Courts, in accordance with the
standard procedures of the Civil Procedure[^spain_82]. While the principles of
international private law applicable to software (applicable in Spain as
in any other EU jurisdiction) may complicate the question as to where a
case may be brought, Spanish courts follow EU Regulations in the matter
(Brussels and Rome I and II Regulations[^spain_83]). Depending on the cause of
action taken (IPR breach, contractual breach) and the nature and
domiciles of the parties, the courts and applicable law may vary.

Criminal law also sanctions copyright breaches for commercial (profit)
purposes[^spain_84], providing jail sentences up to two years and/or
equivalent fines (12-24 months) for those who, for profit and in
prejudice to a third party, reproduce, distribute or publically
communicate a work or its derivative, in any media, without the
corresponding authorisation from the rightsholder. The same sanction is
given to those who would import, export or stock copies of works without
authorisation, and those who manufacture, import or deal in any device
specifically aimed to supress or neutralise technological protection
measures applied to protect software or other protected works.

### Damages

Damage caused by copyright violations are compensated under Spanish law
in accordance with the Articles 138 and 140 Copyright Act, and generally
applicable principles of law relating to unlawful acts (extracontractual
infringements) and breaches of contract[^spain_85]. According to the specific
provisions of Article 140 of the Copyright Act, an injured party of a
copyright breach may request compensation for the loss actually suffered
and profits that were not gained. This can be calculated as either a)
the negative economic consequences (including loss of profit / profits
made by the infringer) or b) the amount the licensor would have received
had the infringer asked for consent to use the protected work in the
infringing manner[^spain_86]. Dual damages, triple damages or other forms of
punitive or special damages are not awarded under Spanish law. Costs
spent on tracing and prosecuting infringements may also be
compensated[^spain_87] and authors, when involved may also claim for breach of
moral rights, giving rise to further damages.

Infringements of software copyrights follow the same regime as
infringements of every other copyright[^spain_88]. The aforementioned
principle is therefore applicable in the case of copyright infringements
of software. Infringements of copyright protected software distributed
under a FOSS license would be sanctioned in the same manner (including
provisional and precautionary measures such as seizure of infringing
works, interlocutory injunctions, etc.). In no way whatsoever has the
author given up his/her rights.

It is yet to be seen whether the argument that, having given up rights
to royalties in the FOSS license, the licensor’s right to damages would
be limited, is correct. We would differ. Besides establishing his/her
reputation and recognition, an author can have other reasons to make a
work “freely” available[^spain_89]. The author may also have a direct monetary
advantage from the free distribution of his work. The simplest way is
circulating the free works with advertising. Another way is providing
specific services relating to the work. The free circulation of the work
ensures the work has many users. The author generates his/her income
from the provision of support and consulting services, licensing
“proprietary” add-ons[^spain_90], or so-called “dual licensing” the code. This
model uses --- as the name indicates — two different licenses for
distribution of the software. The first license is often a FOSS copyleft
license and ensures the work is circulated quickly and has a wide range
of users. A second license (without the copyleft obligations) can then
be obtained against payment by interested parties who want to use the
work without their own additions or modifications being affected by
copyleft[^spain_91].
