> As legal systems differ throughout the world there are significant
> differences in how Free and Open Source Software licenses are treated
> in different countries, and it can be difficult to obtain reliable
> information on national interpretations. The International Free and
> Open Source Software Law Book engages with this by providing a clear
> yet thorough analysis of Free and Open Source legal matters written
> and maintained by local experts.
>
> The publication is targeted towards lawyers, jurists and academics,
> and positioned as an international bench mark reference work. It
> provides an introduction to software protection, a general analysis of
> FOSS under local legislation and an overview of local FOSS cases (if
> any) for each country covered.
>
> The 2nd Edition of the book features both new and updated chapters to
> ensure professionals remain abreast of the latest developments and
> market growth of Open Source.
