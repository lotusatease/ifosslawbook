## Files

This are the working parts:

- `src/` contains the current sources in MarkDown
- `IFOSSLB.pdf` is the PDF of the whole book
- `README.markdown` is this file


## Naming convention

The individual source files are named according to the following convention:

```
10-Intro.markdown
20-History.markdown
50-Belgium.markdown
50-China.markdown
50-...

```

The position of the chapters Intro, History and is predetermined and the country chapters can simply be added as `50-$country_name.markdown` and they will be generated in the right order without the need to manually keep track of the order in a separate file. This also leaves space to introduce new groups of chapters before or after, as well.


## Generating the PDF with Pandoc

Generating a full-book PDF now works by running (requires Pandoc 2.0 or later):

```
pandoc --top-level-division=chapter --number-sections --latex-engine=xelatex -s -f markdown_strict+footnotes+auto_identifiers+implicit_header_references+header_attributes+yaml_metadata_block metadata.yaml src/*markdown -o IFOSSLB.pdf
```

Useful explanations:

- `--top-level-division=chapter` treats the top level headings as separate chapters and makes them start on a new page.
- `--number-sections` adds number to the sections so it is possible to determine the level of each heading


## Generating the ePub with Pandoc

Generating a full-book ePub now works by running (requires Pandoc 2.0 or later):

```
pandoc --top-level-division=chapter --number-sections -s -f markdown_strict+footnotes+auto_identifiers+implicit_header_references+header_attributes+yaml_metadata_block metadata.yaml --epub-cover-image='cover.png' src/*markdown -o IFOSSLB.epub
```
